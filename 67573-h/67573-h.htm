<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>

</div>

<p>The author of the following pages met with his
death in Switzerland on July 16th, 1895, in his
twenty-sixth year. Had he lived to complete the whole
work of which they form part, he might have recast it
throughout; and some apology is, perhaps, needed for
its appearance in the present form. Several scholars
have, however, expressed their opinion that the material
contained in the extant fragments might be useful to
those engaged in similar studies, and they are accordingly
published, in the hope that this may prove to be
the case.</p>

<p>From the author’s papers it appears that his work was,
if completed, to have been entitled “Women in Greek
Poetry: being an Enquiry into the Origin of the
Romantic Element in Literature.” It was to have contained
three divisions, dealing respectively with (1) the
position occupied by women in the Greek lyric and
tragic poets, (2) the part played by women in Greek
comedy, (3) the Alexandrian ideal of woman. The
former of the two essays contained in this volume
(“Women in Greek Poetry”) no doubt includes much
that would have been incorporated in the first of these
three divisions. At the same time, as it was, in all
probability, written before the whole scheme was arranged,
and was intended to be complete in itself, it
contains allusions to certain subjects which would more
naturally have fallen into the third, and would have
received fuller treatment there, while several points
which belong properly to the first division have not
been treated on the scale which would finally have belonged
to them. The second essay (“Women in Greek
Comedy”) corresponds more nearly in subject to the
author’s matured plan, but had still less than the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
essay the benefit of his final correction and revision.
This much is said, not in order to deprecate criticism
(a result which the author would have been the last to
desire), but merely in explanation of the occasional
repetitions, and possibly also inconsistencies, which are
to be found in this volume.</p>

<p>In preparing the work for the Press as few alterations
as possible have been introduced, and the essays appear
substantially in the form given them by the author.
Thus the second essay is divided into nine chief
sections, while the first has no such sub-divisions.
Again, Excursus F (which was originally written for the
first essay) contains much material which is elaborated
in the second essay. In several places also, especially
towards the close of the volume, reference is made to
parts of the work which seem never to have been
written. It is believed that the reader will be anxious
to possess the author’s own words so far as possible,
and, accordingly, the changes which have been adopted
are only such as the author would probably have made
himself when revising his work.</p>

<p>In references to the Greek lyric poets, the numbers
are those of Bergk’s <i>Poetae Lyrici Graeci</i> (4th edition,
1878-82). The fragments of the tragedians are cited
from Nauck’s <i>Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta</i> (2nd
edition, 1889). For the comic fragments the author
used Meineke’s <i>Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum</i> (five
vols. 1839-57). Meineke’s numbering has been kept in
the text, but a list will be found on <a href="#TABLE_OF_COMIC_FRAGMENTS">page 253</a>, giving the
corresponding references to Kock’s <i>Comicorum Atticorum
Fragmenta</i> (three vols. 1880-88) in all cases where the
two editions differ seriously. The references to Theocritus,
Plautus, and Terence have been verified from the
editions of Ziegler, Ritschl, and Dziatzko, respectively;
but where the text is doubtful, the author appears to
have adopted what seemed to him the most probable
reading, without following any editor exclusively.</p>

<p>Additions by the editor of this volume are enclosed
in square brackets. He has to acknowledge most gratefully
his indebtedness to several friends for advice and
assistance on various points.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WOMEN_IN_GREEK_POETRY"><span class="smcap">Women in Greek Poetry</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Greek literature may be divided roughly into
two parts, the earlier school which culminated
at Athens, and the later school which culminated at
Alexandria. The obvious differences between these
two schools of art have often been described, and
there is no need to dwell on them here; but the
great, the essential difference between them has been
too generally ignored.</p>

<p>The chief inspiring element of all art is love; and
it is in their inspiration—that is to say, in their view
of love—that the real difference between the two
schools consists. The love of the later poetry is the
love of man for woman; the love of the earlier
poetry is the love of man for man.</p>

<p>By “love” I mean here love in the modern sense.
A man of the Alexandrian Age might say “I love
you” to a woman, and mean by that what a man
may mean if he says as much to-day; before that
time a man could only have said “I love you” in this
sense to a friend of his own sex. There is no trace
in literature of what we now understand by the
word “love” earlier than the end of the fourth
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>This phenomenon has been noticed before—indeed,
it is one that could not very well escape notice—though
its true importance has not always been
appreciated; and the general consensus of opinion
has agreed to ascribe this great change, the greatest
change perhaps that has ever come over art, to the
influence of two men, Euripides and Menander. My
object in writing now is to endeavour to show, firstly,
that this general view is a mistaken one, arising from
an insufficient appreciation of the true nature of the
change; and secondly, that the real originator of that
new feeling which we encounter in Alexandrian
literature,—in other words, the first man who had the
courage to say that a woman is worth loving,—was
Antimachus of Colophon.</p>

<p>The commonly accepted view as to the origin of
that “romantic” feeling (for so, for briefness’ sake, it
will be convenient to call it)<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which meets us in
Alexandrian literature, would seem to be due to a
confusion, arising from a misunderstanding of what
that feeling really is. This confusion takes two distinct
forms. Thus, in the case of some writers, the
improved tone with regard to women which appears
in Greek erotic literature from the fourth century
onwards, has been confounded with that improvement
in their social and intellectual position which was so
marked a feature of the latest period of the history<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of classical Greece. In other words, romantic feelings
have been spoken of as if they were identical with
feelings of social and intellectual respect. That they
are not, scarcely requires even to be stated. Others
again, while perceiving the distinction between these
two entirely different things, have yet argued as if the
one were the natural and inevitable outcome of the
other, and inseparably connected therewith; as if, in
fact, all that was necessary to purify and elevate the
feelings of men towards women had been the social
emancipation of the latter. This view is of course
possible, and as such is entitled to consideration
rather than the previous one; but not only is it
improbable in itself, but it is also in direct opposition
to the teaching of history: for while no one would
deny that this emancipation, if more or less simultaneous
with the appearance of the romantic feeling,
would serve at once to disseminate and to dignify it,
how entirely independent the one is of the other is
sufficiently proved by the conditions prevailing in the
Middle Ages. It is surely a fact which cannot well
be ignored in discussing this question, that just
during that period of history when “chivalry” and
“romance” were at their height, the social and
intellectual position of women, both absolutely and
relatively, was perhaps lower than at any time before
since the creation of the world.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>When once the romantic element is cut clear from
all extraneous entanglements, so that it is possible to
recognise what it really is, it becomes, I think, immediately
evident that neither Euripides nor Menander
can have much to do with its origin. The leading
motive of romance is the idea that pure love for a
woman may justifiably form the chief interest in a
man’s life. But this idea, as I hope to be able to
show clearly, does not appear in literature until after
the time of Euripides, while it is already to be found
fully developed before the time of Menander. This
being so, it seems impossible to regard either of these
writers as the originators of it.</p>

<p>In the course of the following pages, I shall therefore
endeavour to show, by a detailed examination of
such parts of the contemporary literature as bear
upon the subject, that low as was the social position
of woman in most parts of Greece during the so-called
classical period, the place which she occupied
in the minds of men and in their art was even lower,
and that her subsequent social emancipation did not
by any means immediately lead to her being regarded
with any more real respect. In the course of this
argument, I purpose to dwell especially on the
influence of Euripides, and hope to succeed in
making it clear that though he, as judged by his
works, was strongly in favour of giving women
larger liberties, and firmly convinced that their
capacities both for good and evil were far greater
than the more old-fashioned among his contemporaries
supposed, there is yet nowhere in his plays
any real love-element as between man and woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
nor is it anywhere suggested that love for a woman
may be a determining factor in a man’s life.</p>

<p>Secondly, I purpose by a similar process to show
that that place which in later Greek art and in
modern times is occupied by the love of man for
woman, was occupied among the earlier Greeks by
the love of man for man—a fact which, though it
may at first sight appear foreign to the immediate
subject of our enquiry, is yet of such extreme importance
for a true understanding of the history of
the origin of the romantic feeling, that a consideration
of it can on no account be omitted from any work
professing in any way to deal with that question.
For it cannot be too strongly emphasised that those
who wish to study the development of love, as we
now know it, must commence their studies with an
examination of this essentially primitive emotion.
It cannot be too strongly emphasised that love, as it
now exists, has been evolved, not from the sexual
instinct, but from the companionship of the battle-field,
that the first real lovers the world ever knew
were comrades in arms. The <i>Iliad</i> of Homer is a
love story, its heroes Achilles and Patroclus; the
<i>Ajax</i> of Sophocles is a love story, its heroes Ajax
and Teucer. To ignore such facts as these is wilfully
to misunderstand the meaning of Greek poetry and
the meaning of Greece in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Having thus cleared the ground, I hope finally to
show that it was Antimachus who first taught that
that love which was possible between man and man
was possible also between man and woman.</p>

<p>Antimachus stands at the junction of the two great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
tendencies of his time. The influence of Sparta and
of Euripides was gradually re-emancipating women,
and showing that their powers and their passions
were at least equal to those of men; the steady
growth and development of that relation between
man and man which found its highest exponent in
Plato had made it clear, even to the blindest, that
love was possible as distinct from lust. It was left to
Antimachus to unite the two streams of thought in
one, and to show that woman, with her newly-awakened
capabilities, was a worthy object of pure
and chivalrous devotion.</p>

<p>The works of Antimachus are lost, and none of the
few fragments which survive are of any importance.
All discussion with reference to them must therefore
be based on suppositions and an examination of
relative probabilities. The risks of error in entering
on such doubtful ground are manifestly infinite, and
conclusions can be reached only through the accumulation
of a mass of evidence, the separate particles of
which are often in themselves of very little weight;
the veil of darkness covering all such Greek literature
as does not bear the hall-mark of Athens is so thick
that it is perhaps no longer possible for the real truth
about it ever to be known. <i>Ceterum, fiat justitia.</i>
It is a bold claim, I know, that I am making for
Antimachus; it is a claim which, if established, would
give him right to rank among the greatest poets of
the world: it would give him right to rank as the
founder of modern literature. How great a poet he
really was we do not know. Perhaps my estimation
of his importance is altogether exaggerated. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
contemporaries, we know, preferred Choerilus; perhaps
they were right; for myself, <i>Malo cum Platone errare</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">It is generally agreed that in prehistoric times the
position of women among the Greeks was a much
higher one than was the case subsequently. There
seems every reason to believe that the social conditions
of the Lesbians and the Dorians and the
other nations which did not come under the influence
of the history-writing Ionians, were but the survivals
of what was originally a more or less general state.
It is of considerable assistance for a proper comprehension
of the earliest literature, if one remembers
that at the time of its production the enslavement of
women had only comparatively recently taken place.</p>

<p>The reason of the influence of primitive woman
over primitive man is probably not very far to seek.
In early times women were regarded with superstitious
reverence<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—one need only watch a woman
making lace, say, to be able nowadays still to quite
appreciate the feeling—and with natural woman’s wit
for a time kept up the illusion, the hard head of man
taking some time to come to maturity. But when
man did at last wake to the fact that he was physically,
and therefore, for practical purposes, generally
superior, an inevitable reaction set in, and the history
of early Greece shows women as occupying on the
whole a very low position—a position, too, which
became lower still with advancing civilisation.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>That the original state of women was not one of
slavery is clearly shown by the early epics. The
<i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> are pictures of an earlier state
of society than that of the poet who describes them.
A man living in a society in which women were
despised, had to deal with legends belonging to an
earlier social condition, in which women played a
prominent part. Traces of this anomaly are easy to
find in both poems. The Trojan war was the work
of a woman, but how very little that woman appears
in the <i>Iliad</i>! A woman has been managing the
affairs of Odysseus for twenty years in an exemplary
fashion; but the hero of the <i>Odyssey</i> on his return
prefers to associate with the swineherd. It is by this
contradiction between the actual experiences of the
poet and the social conditions which he was called
upon to depict, that the many inconsistencies in the
treatment of the Epic woman must be explained.</p>

<p>Another excellent illustration of this conflict
between the primitive and the subsequent views of
the nature and importance of women is furnished by
the elaborate treatment of the Pandora legend in the
<i>Opera et Dies</i> of Hesiod. On the one hand is the
early conviction of the power of women’s influence—it
is only by the help of a woman that Zeus can outwit
man: on the other the later conviction that this
influence must be for evil—before Pandora came</p>

<p>And, lastly, it is through a woman that trouble
comes into the world; but it is this same woman’s
doing that Hope at least is left. It was Pandora
herself that shut down the lid of the casket before
Hope had flown; it was she that preserved this
“dream of waking hours” for mankind.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But if we pass from the general condition of women,
as depicted in Homer or Hesiod, and come to our
own more immediate subject, it must be admitted
that neither in the prehistoric legends, nor in their
subsequent development, is there any trace whatever
of a romantic sentiment existing between
men and women to be found. Considering the
important position occupied by women in these
poems, the absence of the love element is most
remarkable.</p>

<p>The insignificant part played by Briseis has always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
struck those who have wished to regard the <i>Iliad</i> as
an Achilleis, of which she is the heroine; nor can
Agamemnon’s love for the daughter of Chryses be
said to go very deep. He is distressed at losing her,
no doubt, but the loss is far from irremediable.
He evidently agrees with Antigone, πόσις ἄν μοι
κατθανόντος ἄλλος ἦν.</p>

<p>Paris again had originally been a celebrated warrior,
and it was to this that he owed his position and his
name. But his love for Helen, instead of inspiring
him, seems to have had the very opposite effect. One
exception there is, no doubt, to all this—the relation
between Hector and Andromache. But the relation
between Hector and Andromache (as illustrated by
<i>Iliad</i> vi. 392, <i>seqq.</i>) is unparalleled in all Greek literature,
and it is not, perhaps, without significance that
they are Trojans and not Greeks. How great was
the impression that they made is visible in the way in
which the later literature cites Andromache rather
than any Greek woman as the ideal of a wife. At
the same time, how little really sympathetic to the
Greek of the period was this wonderful and unique
passage is sufficiently shown by this very fact, that
no attempt was ever made to imitate or develop it.
It may sound strange to say so, but in all probability
we to-day understand Andromache better than did
the Greeks for whom she was created; better, too,
perhaps than did her creator himself.</p>

<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i>, well nigh the entire action is in the
hands of women. What with Athene and Leucothea,
Circe and Calypso, Nausicaa and Penelope, Odysseus
himself hardly comes to the fore at all; and yet it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
cannot be said that anywhere from beginning to end
is there so much as a suggestion of a love-motive.</p>

<p>Nausicaa is always regarded as a charming type of
woman, but, after all, how one naturally thinks of
her is as a charming type of washerwoman. Penelope
again is merely the ideal housekeeper: she longs for
the return of her husband, no doubt, but what really
grieves her about the suitors is not their suggestions
as to his death, but the quantity of pork they eat.</p>

<p>As for any idea that her devotion requires similar
constancy on the part of Odysseus, it is not so much
as suggested. The <i>Odyssey</i> opens, it is true, with its
hero longing to see even the smoke of his home
rising in the air; but it must be remembered that he
has been spending seven years alone with Calypso on
a desert island, which for a man of his tastes was
doubtless exceedingly tedious. There is no reason to
suppose that he did not enjoy the first year or so of
his stay quite as much as his visit to Circe or
Aeolus.</p>

<p>An examination of other Greek myths and legends
that have any claim to antiquity will furnish a very
similar result. Whether in those myths of gods and
heroes which found their way into literature from its
beginning, or in those local legends which, though
first appearing in the Alexandrian writers, are evidently
in reality much older, wherever the antiquity
of the story can be proved, two characteristics are
very noticeable. The first is the importance of
women as the originators of the action; the second
is the absence of the romantic element. The capabilities
of women are thoroughly recognised, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the tendency of the time is to describe their influence
as for evil rather than as for good; their importance
is everywhere admitted: but that a man should be
really or seriously in love with a woman is a thing
unknown.</p>

<p>This is certainly at first sight a strange anomaly,
and yet it is, perhaps, capable of explanation. The
developer of the myth could not fail to be confronted
by a great contradiction—the traditional importance
of women and their actual condition of repression.
He saw in the stories the women, like Medea or
Ariadne, profoundly influencing the career of their
lovers, while the men, like Jason or Theseus, stood
helplessly and more or less apathetically on one
side. The converse of such positions he naturally
did not find. His surroundings forbade his drawing
the true deduction, that the stories were intended to
illustrate the helplessness of men without a woman
to direct them; he drew therefore the contrary
deduction, that the dignity and superiority of man
prevented him from taking an active interest in any
matter where a woman was concerned. From this
deduction, combined with all that was known of the
emotional and passionate character of feminine
nature, there followed that view of the relation
between man and woman which is so noticeable in
all the myths and legends as we find them in literature.
A woman may be desperately in love with a
man, but the converse is impossible.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Love may lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
women to humiliation, to treachery, to crime, and to
suicide, but never, except under the most extraordinary
circumstances, men.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The most cursory examination of the ordinary and
most familiar Greek legends will sufficiently illustrate
this.</p>

<p>Ἐκ Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα. Of the many amours of Zeus,
the only one of at all a permanent character, the
only one which he thought it worth his while to
legalise, was that for Ganymede.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> His treatment of
Minos, again, was very different from that which any
of his female friends received.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The goddesses suffer for their indiscretions, never the
gods. Aphrodite’s pathetic confession to Anchises,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
or her agony for Adonis, the helpless devotion of
Luna to Endymion, or of Aurora to Tithonus, can
find no parallels among the stories of the gods.
Love may drive Apollo to tend cattle, but it is love
for Admetus.</p>

<p>In the lower stratum of humanity, the treachery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Medea or Ariadne, the story of Scylla<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with its
dozen variants, the guilt of Stheneboea, of Myrrha,
of Pasiphae, the deaths of Byblis or Phyllis,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> are but
a few of the more obvious examples.</p>

<p>The idea that a man could be subject to such
passions is not to be found till much later in the
history of the legends. The original version of the
story makes Eriphanis follow Menalcas through the
forest and die for his disdain;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that Menalcas should
afterwards die of love for Euhippe is an addition by
Hermesianax.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the old legend, Daphnis is the
companion of Artemis, and the nymph who loves
him seeks him in vain by every fountain and by
every grove;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> it is Sositheus who tells of his search
for his lost Pimplea,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and Alexander Aetolus, or
whoever Tityrus may be, who sets him wandering
over the mountains after Xenea.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A good commentary on all this is furnished by the
stories selected, apparently more or less at random,
by Parthenius in his Περὶ Ἐρωτικῶν Παθημάτων,
and an examination of this work (dedicated to the
Roman Cornelius Gallus) may serve to show how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
tenaciously the original idea of the relative positions
of men and women retained its hold even among the
“romantic” Alexandrians.</p>

<p>The stories narrated by Parthenius number 36
in all.</p>

<p>In three cases, those of Leucophrye (5), Peisidice
(21), and Nanis (22), love induces women to betray
their country to the enemy; in each case the suggestion
of treachery is made by them. In one case a man,
Diognetus (9), is guilty of similar treachery, but here
he is trapped into it by an oath to his lady to do
whatever she asks him—an oath which he swears
without thinking what it may imply; and, besides,
he betrays, not his own countrymen, but merely his
allies.</p>

<p>Of other sorts of treachery there is enough and to
spare, and always attributed to the woman. Penelope
(3), out of jealousy, induces Odysseus to kill his son
Euryalus; Erippe (8), owing to her love for a barbarian,
plots against her husband’s life; Cleoboea
(14) tries to seduce Antheus, and, failing, murders
him.</p>

<p>Where a man is led by love to any unnatural
crime, it is invariably excused as being the result
of temporary insanity or the vengeance of some
deity. Leucippus (5) falls in love with his sister κατὰ
μῆνιν Ἀφροδίτης; for Byblis (11) no such excuse is
alleged. Clymenus (13) violates Harpalyce διὰ τὸ
ἔκφρων εἶναι; Orion, Hero (20) ὑπὸ μέθης ἔκφρων;
Assaon’s love for his daughter Niobe (33) is a punishment
from Leto; Dimoetes’ love for a corpse (31) is
brought on by a curse. The sins of Neaera (18)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and Periander’s mother (17) have no such palliative.
The unique case in which Alcinoe (27) is driven κατὰ
μῆνιν Ἀθήνης to elope with a stranger (as a punishment
for sweating her sempstress) is derived from
Moero, who would naturally regard women from a
peculiar point of view.</p>

<p>Lastly, Rhesus (36) and Leucippus (15) are, it is
true, induced, like Eriphanis, to follow the objects of
their affection into the hunting-field, but in each case
their devotion is very promptly rewarded.</p>

<p>The foregoing examination of the myths and
legends of early Greece has led to certain definite
results; but the importance of these results has been
in many cases discounted by the impossibility of
assigning any even approximate date to the myth or
legend from which they have been drawn. Even if,
in the case of any given legend, one could determine
with certainty the occasion of its first appearance in
literature, one would in reality be very little nearer
determining the date of the legend itself. To the
stories in Homer everyone is willing to allow a
respectable antiquity; but who can say how long
the story of Phaedra had been current at Troezen
before Sophocles adopted it? It is satisfactory therefore
to be able to leave this doubtful ground, and
come to something more definite, in the shape of the
actual words of the subjective lyric writers, who
belong to the second stage of Greek literature.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, generally agreed that romantic love-poetry
was not produced by the early Greek lyric
writers. What is less generally appreciated is the
fact that these writers, at any rate before the time of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Anacreon, wrote practically no love-poetry (addressed
to women) at all.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> So little indeed has this fact or
its meaning been understood, that not a few passages
in the fragments of these writers have been misinterpreted
or strained; but really, if one comes to think
of it, this absence of love-poetry is quite capable of
explanation. The subjective lyric literature of early
Greece, which extends roughly over the seventh and
sixth centuries, and lasts on, in a desultory sort of
way, into the fifth, is chiefly Ionian, and introduces
one to a very different state of society from that of
the heroic age. The actual social and intellectual position
of women is, in the main, a very low one; and
in other respects also the place which they occupy in
the interests of men is very insignificant. But this is
not all. The ideal woman of the time is not one
to whom love-poetry could be addressed. The Greek
of this period looked upon a woman as an instrument
of pleasure, and as a means of creating a family,
nothing more. The comparison of marriage to cattle-breeding
sounds quite natural.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Now such feelings
as these can neither of them provide the material for
love-poetry of even the most rudimentary kind.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The former of these two ideals we shall have
frequent opportunities of encountering in the next
few pages. A striking commentary on the latter,
and, of course, more general one, is furnished
by that important document for the early history
of women in Greece, the “satire” of Simonides. If
one examines the types of women that Simonides
describes, and the objections that he urges against
them, and compares these with the types one encounters
in Juvenal, for instance, a noteworthy fact
at once becomes apparent. The faults which Simonides
blames, as well as the virtues he somewhat
grudgingly commends, are simply those which concern
woman as a housekeeper; those faults and vices
which provoke the indignation of Juvenal are but
lightly touched upon, or not mentioned at all. One
woman is slovenly, another talks her husband’s head
off, another is always eating, another is a thief, another
is too fine a lady to do any cooking or sweeping;
and the only three definite virtues of the woman
“like a bee” are, that her husband’s income increases,
that her children are satisfactory, and that
she does not waste her time gossiping with the
neighbours.</p>

<p>Indeed, the famous lines (<i>Fr.</i> 6)—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">γυναικὸς οὐδὲν χρῆμ’ ἀνὴρ ληΐζεται</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἐσθλῆς ἄμεινον οὐδὲ ῥίγιον κακῆς,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">might almost be translated, “There is nothing better
in the world than a good cook, and nothing worse
than a bad one.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>Simonides grumbles a great deal, and thinks most
women a great nuisance; that a woman could be
more than a nuisance, or, if God were good, possibly
a convenience, does not enter his head.</p>

<p>A century and a half later we find little change.
Phocylides divides woman into four types: three
bad—the flirt, the slattern, and the shrew; one good,
the efficient housekeeper.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Another hundred years
later the ideal of a wife is still unchanged.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>There was little reason, then, for these Greeks to
address love-poetry to their women, or, indeed, to
sing of “love,” otherwise than in its purely animal
aspect, at all. It remains to convince oneself, by
an examination of what remains of their works, that
they actually did not. It is, of course, a very general
opinion that Archilochus, the earliest lyric poet about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
whom we know anything of moment, addressed love-poetry
to a woman, Neobule.</p>

<p>This view rests mainly on two fragments (<i>Fr.</i> 84,
103), which it is customary to consider as having been
addressed by the poet to his lady at an early stage of
their acquaintance, or as being, perhaps, recollections
of this happy state.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Where all is uncertain, one
does not like to speak with confidence, but there
really seems to be no adequate reason for supposing
that they are anything of the kind. There is nothing,
whatever in <i>Fr.</i> 84</p>

conjunction with those that go before and those that
follow it. The whole scene described in these fragments<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
is very suggestive of the story in Proverbs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
vii. 6 <i>seqq.</i> A lady of mature charms (100) and somewhat
doubtful character (101, 102) receives a youthful
visitor, whose feelings are described in <i>Fr.</i> 103</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">τοῖος γὰρ φιλότητος ἔρως ὑπὸ καρδίην ἐλυσθείς</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">κλέψας ἐκ στηθέων ἀταλὰς φρένας.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The subsequent fragments deal with the arrival of
the husband, and the change to the more rapid metre
must have been very effective. This context, of
course, makes it clear that φιλότητος ἔρως means
simply <i>coitus cupido</i>, and there is no reason to suppose
that this fragment ever formed part of what could
properly be called an erotic passage.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, all that we know of Archilochus
tends to make it extremely improbable that he
addressed love-poetry in any sense of the word to
women. There is no evidence that he addressed any
poems to Neobule (or for that matter to any other
woman) except satires. In these satires we know
that he referred to Neobule in terms of the vilest
abuse. There is no evidence in his fragments that
he ever referred to her otherwise. What reason, then,
is there to suppose that he did? His love for her,
such as it was, was confessedly purely animal.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This
is not the kind of love that finds consolation in
reminiscences and regrets. His pride was hurt, and
he determined to take vengeance on the persons who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
had offended him. If one of these persons happened
to be a woman, that was just as much a matter of
chance as the fact that one of the enemies of
Hipponax was a sculptor. The woman, like the
sculptor, had tried to make the poet ridiculous, and
the poet proceeded to have his revenge by satirising
her. The fact that she was a woman may have given
the satires a certain peculiar colouring, but it certainly
did not make them love-poems. Under the circumstances
it was not to be expected that Archilochus
should express his feelings in erotic poetry, and, as a
matter of fact, on the present evidence there is no
reason to believe that he did.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The claims of Alcman in this respect seem at first
sight somewhat stronger.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He has been described as
ἡγεμὼν ἐρωτικῶν μελῶν;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> this has been supposed to
mean that he was the first poet who wrote love-poems,
and it has been assumed that these poems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
were addressed to women. This is not, however, all so
certain as one might at first be inclined to suppose.</p>

<p>It has been said that Alcman was ἡγεμὼν ἐρωτικῶν
μελῶν; but in how far were these μέλη ἀκόλαστα
love-poems as we now understand them? All that
the words of Archytas imply is that Alcman wrote
melic poems, of which “love” was the chief subject.
There is nothing whatever to prove that these μέλη
were personal, or addressed to any particular woman;
it is a misuse of words to call them “love-poems,”
and then think of them as if they were what modern
love-poems are. As soon as subjective poetry came
to be written at all, it is obvious that the sexual
passions must have appeared in it in some form.
This no one would wish to deny. But there is a
great gap between singing of “love” in general, of
the pleasures of</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">κρυπταδίη φιλότης καὶ μείλιχα δῶρα καὶ εὐνή,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and singing of love as existing between two particular
persons. It is a commonplace that every new lover
loves as no one has ever done before. Until a poet
speaks of himself in this way, until he emphasises
the individuality of his own particular passion, he
cannot be said to write real love-poetry. And
certainly the fragments, at any rate, do not supply
any proof that Alcman ever wrote such love-poetry.
He may have been in love with Megalostrate; as far
as we know, he never said so.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Again, it must not be forgotten that Alcman also
wrote poems addressed to boys, and it is at least
possible that some of those erotic fragments which
are preserved may have belonged to these.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>As for the <i>Parthenia</i>, they are not love-poems in
any sense of the word. The poet is merely ὁ τῶν
παρθένων ἐπαινέτης τε καὶ σύμβουλος,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> which was
possible in the happy condition of Spartan society,
quite without anything further being implied.</p>

<p>One of these poems was written in old age;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
perhaps all of them were.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Besides, they celebrate
a number of girls indifferently; love-poems would
not do that.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Till Egypt renders up some more Alcman, it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
be impossible to prove that he ever addressed a love-poem
to a woman.</p>

<p>Strange as it may perhaps seem, it is almost an
equal misuse of words to call Mimnermus a love-poet.
It has so long been customary to regard him
as such, that it is at first hard to realise that, in all
probability, he was never anything of the kind. As
a matter of fact, it seems naturally reasonable to
suppose, and there is at any rate nothing in the
fragments to contradict this view, that Mimnermus
was, like the other elegiac writers of his age, purely
didactic.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The philosophy which he inculcated
differed from that of Tyrtaeus or Solon, no doubt,
but it was none the less a philosophy. Mimnermus
argued that, considering the shortness of life, and
especially of youth, it was advisable to devote one’s
self immediately and strenuously to sensual pleasures,
before the power of enjoying them was lost. The
argument was quite general. “What is life without
love?” he says; he does not say, “What is life
without your love?”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This enunciation of general
principles is not love-poetry. As has already been
remarked, no poetry can properly be so described
until the personal element has entered into it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
of this personal element there is no evidence in the
case of Mimnermus.</p>

<p>As for the actual poems themselves, there is no
evidence that any of them were, as is generally
tacitly assumed, addressed to Nanno or any other
woman; and indeed, if one considers their nature,
one will see that there is really no reason why they
should have been. It is worthy of note, in the first
place, that the only definite evidence of the existence
of such a person as Nanno is that furnished by
Hermesianax,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and that this writer’s information as
to the early poets was not always very accurate, is
sufficiently shown by what he says of Homer,
Sappho, Anacreon, and others.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But granted that
the story of the poet’s love for Nanno was true, that
is very far from proving the fact that he addressed
his poems to her. What seemed only natural in the
fourth century, was by no means so in the seventh.
But besides this (as it ought to be superfluous to
remark, and probably is not), Hermesianax never
states that Mimnermus did so; he does not even go
so far as to say that the latter alluded to Nanno in
his elegies. Hermesianax makes three definite statements
about Mimnermus:—(1) that he invented or
utilised the pentameter; (2) that he was in love with
Nanno, and used often (in consequence?) to attend
entertainments; (3) that he suffered from the enmity
of Hermobius and Pherecles. More than this is not
to be found in the passage, however one may emend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
or explain it. As for the supposition that Mimnermus
gave to his collected elegies the title of Nanno,
there is no evidence of a collection so entitled before
the time of Strabo, by which time, of course, the influence
of writers like Hermesianax had long been at
work.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In short, there is no evidence whatever to lead
one to suppose that the elegies of Mimnermus were
anything but purely impersonal didactic moralisings
on the shortness of youth, and the consequent advisability
of making the best possible use of it.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Mimnermus
was a philosopher;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> to call him a love-poet is a
misuse of words. He wrote exquisite poetry, and his
service in developing the forms of art was unquestionably
very valuable, but he brings us very little farther
in the history of the treatment of women in literature.</p>

<p>It is in Anacreon that we find for the first time
love-poetry addressed to women;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> though one must
never forget, as some modern writers seem inclined
to do, that this writer also addressed a number of
love-poems to boys, and that, in fact, these formed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the bulk of his work.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The poems addressed to
women were many of them, perhaps all, the work
of the poet’s old age,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and their general tone is
sufficiently indicated by such fragments as 55, 59,
161, etc.:<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> these two features serve, of course, to
connect Anacreon with his predecessors; at the same
time, the individualisation of this particular emotion,
which we find here for the first time clearly indicated,
was obviously a great advance in the art of
the subject. Purely animal emotions, however highly
developed or refined, could never lead to that feeling
which we have called the romantic, and hence the
direct importance of Anacreon for our immediate
subject is but small; but the individualisation of
these animal emotions was obviously of inexpressible
importance for the development of the literature that
dealt with them. The first essential of art is accurate
observation, and the essence of accurate observation
is attention to a definite object. By appreciating
this fact, and concentrating upon a definite object
the general emotions described by Mimnermus and
the like, Anacreon created love-poetry as between
man and woman, and thereby created that form of
art in which the romantic feeling, when it arose,
found the readiest means of expression. Thus,
though in no sense of the word a romantic writer,
or one who would have been likely to sympathise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
with romantic ideas, Anacreon was yet, unconsciously
and indirectly, doing an unquestionable service in
preparing the way for the dissemination, if not for
the evolution, of this later feeling; and in so far this
γυναικῶν ἠπερόπευμα deserves, at least, recognition,
if not respect.</p>

<p>The last of the personal lyric writers on whom it
will be necessary to dwell is Theognis.</p>

<p>On the general theory that the book of Theognis
is a collection of poems by a number of writers of
various dates, scholars have agreed to agree; on
the details of the theory, they seem to have agreed
to differ. For the present purpose, however, these
details are unimportant, and it will be sufficient to
assume that, while some of the poems are doubtless
earlier, and others again later, the great bulk of the
first book of the “Theognis” poetry belongs to the
first half of the fifth century, while the second book
is considerably later.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It is equally indifferent for us how this heterogeneous
collection arose; whether it was a chrestomathy
“for the use of schools,” or whether, as has
been argued with great force, it is in reality a
volume of songs to be sung at social gatherings, and
the forerunner of the later collections of epigrams.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>What is of importance for us is that, in any case,
whatever theory as to its origin may be adopted, this
book may be taken as presenting on the whole<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
collection of those opinions and views of life which
were generally held and generally accepted during
the fifth century or thereabouts; for neither the
schoolroom nor the dinner table is exactly the place
where new and startling theories are welcomed.</p>

<p>Looking at this volume, then, as containing a
collection of the ordinary and more or less commonplace
views of the time, it is interesting, though, of
course, not really surprising, to find that, while boy-love
is universally acknowledged and forms the
subject of not a few of the poems, women’s love is
well-nigh entirely ignored;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and where the latter is
mentioned, its sensual side merely is touched upon.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, all the allusions of any importance to
women can be very briefly dismissed.</p>

<p>In l. 183 <i>seqq.</i> marriage is compared to cattle-breeding,
the folly of marrying for money being
deprecated as spoiling the breed.</p>

<p>Ll. 257 <i>seqq.</i> are possibly the complaint of a woman
with an unsuitable husband, though what is the
nature of the objection to him, and indeed the whole
allusion, is not clear.</p>

<p>Ll. 261 <i>seqq.</i> appear to deal with the behaviour of
a man towards a woman on some occasion; but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
what with the doubtfulness of the reading and the
uncertainty as to whether the lines belong to one
poem or two, the exact sense has never yet been
ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In l. 457 <i>seqq.</i> the infidelity of a young wife to an
old man is tacitly assumed. “Girls will have boys.”</p>

<p>Ll. 547 <i>seq.</i> express vague disapprobation of
dissolute habits.</p>

<p>Ll. 1063 <i>seqq.</i> are merely a reiteration of the
philosophy of Mimnermus, the value of which
philosophy for the development of love we have
already discussed.</p>

<p>Ll. 1225 <i>seq.</i>, “Nothing is sweeter ἀγαθῆς γυναικός.”
So said also Simonides, and what he meant we know.</p>

<p>And this is all. The result is truly remarkable
in its barrenness. Perhaps in no other literature
would it be possible to find a collection of short
poems on general subjects, of equal length, in which
the relations of men to women are so utterly ignored.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything peculiar or exceptional in
this. In the somewhat similar <i>Scolia</i>, absolutely
the same is the case. The democrat sings of
Harmodius, the aristocrat of Admetus;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the rare
allusions that there are to women are regularly
trivial or coarse.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In the choral lyric writers, with whom it will now
be necessary to deal, the character of the evidence to
be examined is widely different from that of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
evidence which we have hitherto been considering.
The Greek choral poets were (with one notable
exception) hardly ever subjective in their treatment
of erotic matter. The erotic element, such as it is,
consists in these writers almost entirely of erotic
legends or myths, which would seem to have been recounted
without special comment on the part of the
poet and, in most cases, without elaborate analysis
of the emotions of the characters introduced. The
stories therefore that these writers tell, rather than
the actual words in which they tell them, will require
consideration in the present connection. The subjective
lyric writers were, as we have seen, in the
main Ionian. The choral writers, on the other hand,
are in the main Dorian; consequently, one would
naturally expect to find women occupying a more
prominent place in their works. And this is, in fact,
also the case. From the very beginning, already we
find stories about women repeated with an interest
and an appreciation which would have startled what
one is generally taught to regard as orthodox Greece.
At the same time, however, the true nature of this
feature of choral poetry must not be overlooked.
Though the efforts of these writers to re-awaken
interest in women were unquestionably of importance
for the ultimate development of the romantic element
in literature, it is unjustifiable to suppose, as is too
commonly done, that these writers were in themselves
“romantic,” or, indeed, that they had any idea
of what romantic feelings are. An examination of
their works, as far as we know them, will show with
sufficient clearness that in its essence their view of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
women differed little, if at all, from that of their
Ionian predecessors and contemporaries. They
thought more about women, perhaps; they did not
think more of them.</p>

<p>A case in point is Stesichorus. In spite of the
important part that female characters play in his
poems, a result, no doubt, of his Boeotian connections
and his freedom from Ionian influences, the poet’s
way of regarding women is practically identical with
that which we have already encountered among the
Ionians. In the first place, Stesichorus appears
always, professedly at least, as a misogynist. The
legends in which he delights are those which relate
the ruin caused by women’s influence. Besides the
famous <i>Ilii Persis</i>, one need but mention the stories
of Scylla, of Eriphyle, of Clytemnestra (in the
<i>Oresteia</i>).<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Even in the story of Artemis and
Actaeon, he will not admit that the vengeance of
the goddess was due to those feelings of outraged
propriety to which it was generally ascribed.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> As for
his palinode of Helen, composed late in life, he was
evidently induced to write it by strong private
pressure of some kind, perhaps on the part of “Helen
of Himera”;<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> but how isolated an expression of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
opinion this was, and how very unusual were the
whole circumstances of the case, is shown by the
great interest which the poem excited in antiquity.</p>

<p>In the more purely erotic legends again, it is
striking how he conforms to those views as to the
relative positions of men and women which, as has
been already pointed out, were current in all Greek
erotic stories of early date; the woman falls in love
with the man, never, apparently, the reverse. Striking
examples are the stories of Calyce, and probably also
of Scylla; another, perhaps, that of Daphnis;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that
of Rhadina seems at first sight a contradiction, but it
must be noticed that Strabo (viii. 347) gives no
information as to how the intrigue first began.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>That in addition to these poems concerned with
women, Stesichorus interested himself also in the
treatment of love in its more characteristically Greek
aspect, may be gathered from Athenaeus xiii. 601 A,
though, perhaps, no fragment dealing with this
subject is preserved.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This side is, however, very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
strongly developed in his fellow-countryman Ibycus,
who is again a most interesting figure in the history
of the artistic development of Greek love.</p>

<p>Ibycus would seem to have been the first of the
choral lyric poets who made use of this form of
art for the expression of personal emotion. All
the important fragments of him that remain seem
to have belonged to passages of this kind. Two
at least we know of as being addressed to particular
individuals. Those who have been following the
development of Greek feeling on this matter will
not be surprised to find that these poems were addressed
exclusively, as far as we know, to boys. It
was a bold thing to introduce personal feelings at all
into these choral odes, for a certain odour of sanctity
was still hanging about them, and the Greeks had
a natural aversion to the public expression of
all violent emotions; but to have introduced anything
so entirely sensual as woman’s love was then
felt to be would not have been allowed. If love
was to be tolerated at all, it must be that form
of love which was generally recognised as dignified
and ennobling. This amalgamation of ceremonial and
personal poetry does not seem to have been popular
or to have found imitators. The Greeks probably felt,
what the modern glee-singer does not, the absurdity
of a whole chorus expressing their undying devotion
to one and the same person; but it is at least a
very characteristic fact, and, for those that will not
learn, a very instructive one, that boy-love was the
only form of the passion which it was considered
possible to attempt to treat in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Of Ibycus’ views on women we know little.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
That he followed the tendencies of Stesichorus,
sometimes rather wildly,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and gave considerable
prominence to love stories between women and men,
is clear enough; but there is no evidence to show
that these stories of his were any different in their
essential characteristics to those of his predecessor.</p>

<p>The other choral lyric poets have remarkably
little to say on this subject.</p>

<p>Myrtis’ story of Ochne is but one of the usual
type, showing to what <i>spretae iniuria formae</i> may
lead a woman. If Corinna tells of the heroism of
the daughters of Orion, it is, after all, only what
one would expect occasionally from a poetess.</p>

<p>Neither Pindar nor Simonides has anything of
interest to say about women. For Bacchylides the
climax of the charms of peace is</p>

<p class="noindent">Among the dithyrambic writers, Licymnius tells the
story of the treachery of Nanis, but the sort of
legends which seem to interest him more are
those of Hypnus and Endymion, Hymenaeus and
Argynnus, and the like. The same was perhaps
true of Cydias. But one interesting figure these
writers do supply; that is the Cyclops of Philoxenus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
A good deal has been written about this “romantic”
conception, and it has been generally considered as
a proof of how strongly the romantic feeling must
have been already developed that it was possible
to represent Polyphemus as in love with Galatea.
Those who have considered what has already been
said may perhaps be tempted to come to a somewhat
different conclusion. The barbarous and boorish
Polyphemus spends his time in singing of his love
to Galatea, because no one who was not a barbarian
and a boor would be such a fool as to waste so much
time about a woman. This view spoils the idyllic
charm of the picture rather, perhaps, but it may
be the true one for all that.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the foregoing examination of the remains of
the lyric writers, it was always necessary to regard,
not only the date of each writer, but also the country
to which he belonged; for, as we have already had
occasion to notice, the social position of women
differed widely in different parts of Greece, and this
fact could not fail to be, to a certain extent, reflected
in such literature as dealt with them.</p>

<p>In examining the work of the tragedians, this
necessity will no longer be present. Early Greek
tragedy is entirely under the influence of Athens.
The only tragedians whose works have been to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
considerable extent preserved were Athenians; and
such fragments of the non-Athenian dramatists as
have survived do not in any way lead one to suppose
that their work was in any essential characteristic
different from that of their Athenian contemporaries.</p>

<p>At Athens the social position of women was, on
the whole, a very low one, and consequently the
relations between men and women were not on a
particularly high level. The men cared very little
either for or about the women, and there is nothing
therefore surprising in the generally admitted fact
that the love-element as between the sexes plays but
a very unimportant part in the early tragedians.
Aeschylus seems well-nigh to have ignored it; in
Sophocles it played a prominent part in but two, or
at most three tragedies;<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> even in Euripides the proportion
of plays in which love of any sort supplies
the main interest is very small.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>But one question may very naturally be asked.
Assuming that the way of regarding women at
Athens rendered it difficult or impossible to interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
an Athenian audience with a love-story, as between
man and woman, why should not the tragedians have
made more use of the many stories that told of the
love of men for men? If, it may be argued, this
form of love was really so important an element in
the life of the time, if it really occupied that place in
the hearts of men as a whole that is now occupied by
the love of women, why did Aeschylus and Sophocles
only devote a couple of plays between them to its
treatment?<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Sophocles, at any rate, ought to have
understood all about it.</p>

<p>The answer is probably to be found in the fact
that the passion of love, in any shape or form, is
foreign to the true spirit of Greek tragedy. The
taste of the Greeks, refined in this as in most other
things, considered love as essentially unfitted for the
stage. That two people should stand up and make
love to one another with a crowd looking on was, to
the Greek mind, essentially unfitting. Love was an
emotion which concerned individuals; it was an
emotion which ought to be controlled in public, and
only find expression in private.</p>

<p>The whole history of Greek poetry is so much
commentary on this one fact. The love-poems of
Sappho or Anacreon, just like the later love-poems
of Asclepiades or Poseidippus, were meant to be
sung by a single singer to a small and select audience.
In the choral poetry, which required a number of
performers, and was listened to by a large audience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the personal love-element is well-nigh non-existent.
The attempt of Ibycus to introduce it, and his failure
to find imitators, we have already noticed.</p>

<p>And in the choral poetry sung in honour of Dionysus,
from which tragedy had its rise, it is obvious,
when one considers the intimate connection between
the rites of Dionysus and Artemis, and the ascetic
principle underlying their worship, how especially
out of place a love-element would have been.</p>

<p>The fact, therefore, that love as between man and
man does not play any very prominent part in the
early tragedies, must simply be explained by the
Greek dislike to the public display of violent private
emotions. It took a long time to overcome this old-fashioned
prejudice, and establish the love-element as
an integral part of tragedy; and it is not uninstructive
to observe how the movement began. The
earliest love-story admitted on the Greek stage was
the story of Achilles and Patroclus.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>But before entering upon the more detailed
examination of the relations between the sexes, as
illustrated by the Attic tragedians, it is necessary
once more to call attention to, and warn against,
a very fertile source of confusion.</p>

<p>It is above all things necessary that the reader
should carefully distinguish between two very different
things, two very different ways of regarding
women, which are not uncommonly confused—woman
as an object of interest, and woman as an
object of love. As objects of interest, we find the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
female characters of the tragedians steadily developing
throughout the fifth century; as objects of
love, we do not find them develop at all. The
relations between women and men are, in reality, as
far from the modern in the last plays of Euripides
as in the first of Aeschylus. Towards the close of
the century, a very considerable proportion of the
tragedies concern themselves with studies of female
character in its various phases; the power of women
for good and evil (especially the latter) is very
generally acknowledged; their passions and their
emotions are carefully analysed and elaborately
discussed; and yet in all this analysis and discussion
the love-element, in any modern sense of the word,
plays no part whatever. By this time, woman at
Athens held an important place in the mind of man;
as yet she held no place in his heart at all. From end
to end of the three great tragedians, there can hardly a
single passage be quoted which so much as suggests
the possibility of an unselfish and unsensual attachment
between man and woman, playing at all an
important part in the life of either; and this important
fact it will be the object of the following
pages to make clear.</p>

<p>Aeschylus, as has been said often enough, never
brought on the stage a woman “in love.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> That he
should never have brought on the stage a man in
such a condition went of course without saying;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
even Euripides was never accused of that. Indeed,
Aeschylus’ characters do not think much of women
at all. That girls should not misbehave, if left to
themselves, even their own father finds it hard to
believe;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> that in any sort of difficulty they should be
a hindrance rather than a help, is only what one would
expect.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Women are certainly not worth fighting
about;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> what really acquits Orestes is the fact that,
after all, it was only a woman he killed.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>An apparent exception to all this is of course
Clytemnestra. Why should Aeschylus, having so
poor an opinion of women, have given so prominent
a place to Clytemnestra in the murder of Agamemnon?
The answer is doubtless to be found in
the very significant fact that between Homer and
Aeschylus the story had been treated by Stesichorus,
to whom the prominence of Clytemnestra was
beyond all reasonable doubt due.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Aeschylus, then, has little enough to say about
women; but in Sophocles there is fortunately somewhat
more to be found; indeed, it is probably the
female characters of Sophocles that are most generally
appreciated by modern readers. And yet, for
all the great part played by women in the Sophoclean
drama, the part played by women’s love is wonderfully
small.</p>

<p>Take a woman like Deianira; the man who can
listen to her without feeling a positive shock must
be more in sympathy with Athens than I ever wish
to be.</p>

<p>She guesses the truth from Lichas about Heracles
and Iole (<i>Trach.</i> 436), and begs him to tell her all,
for she is no coward, nor yet is she the sort of
woman who would refuse to admit a husband’s right
to an occasional infidelity.</p>

<p>“Love is irresistible,” she says; “if I were to blame
my husband or this woman for falling victims to it,
I should be a fool. Do not be afraid to tell me all.
Has not Heracles often done this sort of thing before
without making me jealous? Why should he make
me jealous now? And as for the woman, why, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
can only pity her, when I see how her beauty has
made her lose her home and her home comforts,
for which, <i>expertae crede</i>, the love of Heracles is
hardly a sufficient compensation.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When this is Sophocles’ ideal wife, one can hardly
wonder that Haemon owes the only word of sympathy
he gets from his Antigone to the editors.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>But even Deianira has her human moments, and
in one of these she utters that wonderful lament of
hers for the joys of her lost maidenhood, and the
sorrows of her married life (<i>Trach.</i> 144 <i>seqq.</i>), a
passage which may well be compared with one from
the <i>Tereus</i>. (<i>Fr.</i> 524, Nauck). Both these dwell sympathetically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
on the slavery of married life, and almost
make one think at first sight that the poet must have
felt what a mockery his “ideal wife” really was.
But a little further examination will show clearly
enough that Sophocles is not expressing his own
views in either of these two passages. The protest
in the <i>Tereus</i> is merely the direct outcome of the
decidedly exceptional circumstances in which Procne
finds herself—a woman who has just cooked her
only son is hardly likely to have unprejudiced views
on matrimony—and as such it is not meant to be
more than one of those outcries against irresistible
destiny, which one may pity if one likes, or even
pardon, but which one cannot pretend to treat
seriously. For a girl to complain of having to
marry was as reasonable as for a man to complain
of having to die.</p>

    <div class="verse indent24">τί ταῦτα δεῖ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">στένειν, ἅπερ δεῖ κατὰ φύσιν διεκπερᾶν;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As for the passage from the <i>Trachiniae</i>, that seems
to be simply an echo from Sappho, and Sappho’s
views on marriage were naturally different from
those of Sophocles.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>To suppose from these passages that Sophocles
saw anything inappropriate in the existing conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of married life, or that he would have welcomed any
change in them, is an unjustifiable inference.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>But the one play of Sophocles which is generally
considered to be of supreme importance for this particular
subject is the <i>Phaedra</i>. This play, which is
supposed to have been the model for the <i>Hippolytus</i>
of Euripides, is generally looked upon as the first
“love-tragedy” of the Greeks. But was it a “love-tragedy”
at all, in any sense in which the words are
now understood? To judge by analogy, there is
every reason to suppose that it was not.</p>

<p>The fragments unfortunately prove little, for no
very important ones are preserved, and the one or
two of them that do speak of love, merely speak of
it in the regular Sophoclean way, not as a human
passion, but as an unavoidable kind of disease, something
like measles or distemper.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>But in spite of the paucity of the fragments, the
main principle on which the legend (of which we
have already spoken)<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> was treated, is sufficiently
clear; and this principle is such as is, I venture to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
submit, incompatible with the presence in the play
of any real love-element.</p>

<p>Phaedra’s love is not passion but madness, it is not
an emotion but a disease. Aphrodite treats her in
exactly the same way as Athene treats Ajax. Her
love is so entirely outside her control, it is so entirely
the result of external influences, that while one can
perhaps pity her, one certainly cannot sympathise
with her, for the simple reason that her misfortune
is entirely outside human experience. She loves
Hippolytus, as Oedipus kills Laius, for no earthly
reason except that the story said the god made
her do so. The Phaedra of Sophocles, like the
Clytemnestra of Aeschylus, is made an instrument
of divine vengeance for reasons which do not concern
her personally in the least; one pities her, not as an
unhappy lover, but as the victim of fate. She is no
longer a human being influenced by human emotions;
she is simply a tool in the hands of a relentless deity.
In other words, she is never in love with Hippolytus
at all, in any commonly-accepted sense of the
term.</p>

<p>And thus it must be sufficiently clear to anyone
who is able to get rid of preconceived ideas on the
matter, that the <i>Phaedra</i> was in reality no more
“romantic” than the <i>Trachiniae</i> or the <i>Antigone</i>.
Like the rest of the plays of Sophocles, it merely
drew the usual picture of the gods playing shove-halfpenny
with human souls; the fact that Aphrodite
for once took a hand in the game gave it on this
occasion a peculiar character of its own, but of anything
in any way resembling a modern love-element<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
there is no more trace here than there is anywhere
else.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>But what really affords a more conclusive proof
than any other of how utterly anything of the nature
of modern love between man and woman was unknown
to Sophocles, is the remarkable prominence
given in his plays to the affection between brother
and sister.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The relations between Electra and
Orestes, or Antigone and Polynices, are absolutely
those of modern lovers; but Sophocles could not
conceive of such relations as existing between people
whom he would have called “lovers,” and, therefore,
he had to think of the parties to them as brother
and sister. He wished to draw a picture of pure,
noble, and unselfish devotion existing between man
and woman; the only conditions under which such
a thing seemed to him possible were that the man
and the woman should be close blood relations.</p>

<p>There are those who complain of the indifference
of Electra to Pylades, or of Antigone to Haemon,
and think that a little love infused into these heroines
would make them more human. These people have
overlooked the fact that Electra and Antigone are in
reality quite as much in love as ever woman was;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
but they are in love with their brothers. They did
not know it perhaps; Sophocles did not know it;
but the fact remains. Antigone despises love—what
she and her audience thought was love. Between
Polynices and Haemon there is never a moment’s
hesitation; almost her last words are an exclamation
of the bitterest contempt for marriage: “If my
husband had died, I could have married another;
if he had failed to get me children, I could
have committed adultery; but—my brother is
dead!”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>And yet, Antigone comes far nearer to a modern
lover than Phaedra ever does.</p>

<p>This is a fact of the greatest importance in the
present connection, and one that cannot be too much
emphasised. The relation of the sexes was such
among the early Greeks that a pure love between
man and woman seemed to them a sheer impossibility,
and yet their instinct told them that pure love
was not really an impossible thing. The ways in
which the difficulty was surmounted were various.
Of the love of man for man and of woman for
woman we have already spoken; in Sophocles a
third alternative is suggested. The lovers are made
man and woman, but the possibility of sensuality is
first removed by making them brother and sister.
A woman who loves a man may love him purely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
says Sophocles, if she is in such a position that she
cannot love him otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>In the first two of the Athenian dramatists there
are then, as we have seen, practically no traces
whatever to be found of a love-element in any
real sense of the term. But this, it may be said, is
nothing wonderful. This everyone will admit. For
the love-element one looks to Euripides. In the
following examination of Euripides, I hope to show
that not only is love, in any modern sense, quite
unknown to his characters, but also that the whole
“romantic” element of his plays, on which it is the
custom to lay such stress, is much less pronounced
than is generally supposed; in other words, that his
men take really very little interest in his women.</p>

<p>But before discussing what Euripides did not do,
it is well to have a clear conception of what he did
do; for he did do a great deal. The great service
of Euripides to art was that he emphasised unmistakably
the importance of women. He seems to
have been the first emphatically to enunciate that
doctrine of <i>cherchez la femme</i>, which has been the
groundwork of all modern art. He was not the first
man to discover it; the men who made the story of
Troy knew it as well as he did; but he was the
first, as far as we know, consciously to adopt it as
an artistic canon. He was the first deliberately to
maintain that the highest artistic effects were to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
obtained by the contrast of the sexes. The women
of the earlier tragedians, as far as they are of any
interest, are merely women, as it were by accident;
they are men in everything but their dress. The
women of Euripides, however unpleasant they may
be, are always intensely feminine. The emphasis
which Euripides laid on the feminine as opposed to
the masculine element is at once his chief characteristic
and his chief merit.</p>

<p>The ways in which he emphasises the importance
of women are various. Everyone knows the stress he
lays on their power of doing harm; the “misogyny”
of Euripides need hardly be illustrated here.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> At
the same time, he is fully aware of their power for
good.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He dwells on their cleverness repeatedly:
“If supremacy were a matter of brains, and not of
brute force, men would not have a chance.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He is
convinced of their heroism: Iphigeneia goes to her
death with far more dignity than Antigone. He is
even convinced, in a way that not all his successors
have been, of their reasonableness: there are few
men who could discuss their own deaths as calmly
and clearly as Phaedra<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> or Polyxena.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It would be
easy to multiply instances if there were any need to
do so.</p>

<p>All this Euripides did. He made his women
powerful, intelligent, heroic, reasonable. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
make them loved or loveable. In this Euripides is
well-nigh as old-fashioned as any of his predecessors.
In all the extant plays there is not a
single instance of a man in love with a woman;
there is no evidence, except perhaps in one isolated
case,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of such a character in any of the plays that
have been lost. So far from Euripides being the
poet of love between man and woman, there are
numerous situations in his plays where it seems
simply extraordinary to the modern reader how
such obvious opportunities for the introduction of
such love can have been missed or ignored.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>A detailed examination of some of the plays will
bring this out clearly; but before proceeding to this,
it would be well to observe certain of the more
general features of the Euripidean conception of the
relations, other than social and intellectual, existing
between men and women.</p>

<p>The first point to be noticed is that Euripides,
too, just like Sophocles, speaks of love as a sort
of irresistible madness or disease,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> which seizes on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
its victims without any particular reason, and can
only be cured or borne by being allowed to have
free course. It is, as I have said before, exactly
like measles; the only proper treatment is to help
it as much as you can to “come out,” as then it is
less painful at the time, and less likely to have
serious consequences. Instances of this view are
sufficiently numerous. It forms the chief framework
of the <i>Hippolytus</i>, and all attempts to interpret
the emotions of that play in accordance with more
modern notions, are without success. The same
was still more the case in the <i>Phoenix</i>, as Suidas
distinctly implies by his use of the words τῷ υἱῷ
ἐπέμηνε τὴν παλλακήν in this connection.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is enunciated
by Jason to Medea in the <i>Medea</i> (526 <i>seqq.</i>) as
a proof that he owes nothing to her, as she was not
responsible for her actions in saving him; by Helen
to Menelaus in the <i>Troades</i> (945 <i>seqq.</i>) as a perfect
excuse for her conduct with Paris.</p>

<p>Now it is just here, one may as well notice at
once, that the difference between Euripides and
modern writers, with the Alexandrians at their
head, is so striking. The lovers in Euripides, as
far as they are lovers at all, are carried along by a
forcible external impulse, the direction of which is
entirely sensual and entirely selfish. If, or as soon
as, they fail in achieving the gratification of their
sensual desires, their “love” immediately turns to
hate. The idea of devotion or self-sacrifice for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
good of the loved person, as distinct from one’s own,
is absolutely unknown. “Love is irresistible,” they
say, and, in obedience to its commands, they sit
down to reckon how they can satisfy themselves, at
no matter what cost to the objects of their passion.</p>

<p>Love is irresistible still, one knows, as irresistible
now as ever it was in Greece, but the impulse it gives
has a different direction. To put it perfectly crudely,
the Euripidean woman who “falls in love” (it is of
women we are speaking now) thinks first of all,
“How can I seduce the man I love?” The modern
woman thinks, “How can I die for him?” This is
the difference between ancient and modern love, and
in Euripides the old is still untouched by the new.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>It is this sensual, this well-nigh mechanical view
of love which makes possible that conception of the
ideal wife, of which we have already spoken in the
case of Sophocles’ Deianira, and which is so strongly
insisted upon in the Andromache of Euripides.</p>

<p>Andromache regularly appears as the model wife,
not only in the play which bears her name, but also
in the <i>Troades</i>. Her views on married life have,
therefore, a peculiar weight of their own.</p>

<p class="noindent">This is not irony; it is just sober earnest, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
sober earnest morality of respectable Athens. The
view is by no means confined to Andromache. It is
deliberately propounded by Electra to her mother,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
and Jason twice taunts Medea with her failure to
live up to its level.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Indeed, it may be said to
colour, to a certain extent, the whole conception of
married life. For a woman to wish to keep her
husband to herself was a sign that she was at once
unreasonable and lascivious.</p>

<p>This doctrine of the absolute subjection of the
wife<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> is emphasised in various ways. That a really
respectable wife not only always stays at home,
but also never sees visitors, is more or less of an
axiom.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> To give a woman her head is dangerous
in the last degree, and if you do, you will probably
get murdered for your pains.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Suicide for a husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>

for her husband is her life.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>But where is one to find such a model wife? for
marriage is such a lottery that one ought really to
be allowed, if one can afford it, to have several
tickets, in case the first doesn’t turn out well.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The
only chance is to marry a woman of good family;
in other words, the only thing worth marrying for
is rank.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> To prefer to marry for love is not only
foolish, but unfair on one’s children.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>It is this view of married life, this devotion to an
ideal of drudgery on the part of the woman, and
the calm acceptance of such devotion as a matter
of course on the part of the man, which explains
such a play as the <i>Alcestis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The woman is devoted
to the man, not because he is himself, but because
he is her husband. For the man she does not care
in the least, but for the husband—for the ideal of
the family—she is perfectly ready to die. It is this
which at once makes the story of Alcestis possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and robs it of half its pathos. Had Alcestis loved
Admetus as a man, she could not but have felt the
bitterest disappointment at his accepting her offer.
As it is, she seems to regard his conduct almost as
much as a matter of course as he does.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The brief examination of one further point in the
Euripidean view of women may serve as introduction
to the more detailed discussion of the romantic
element in his plays, or, rather, of its absence.
Euripides speaks frequently as if there were a sort
of freemasonry existing among women, which makes
one woman always ready to side with another as
against a man. Instances of this are common,
especially in the relations between the heroine and
the Chorus, when the latter, as mostly in Euripides,
consists of women.</p>

<p>Thus Medea, when asking the Chorus not to
reveal her plans, says—</p>

<p class="noindent">A “romantic” writer might have thought that the
prayers of Menelaus himself would have been more
effectual with a lady.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The most important of the extant plays of
Euripides is, for the student of the development
of the romantic tendency, undoubtedly the <i>Hippolytus</i>.
But, in thinking of this play, the reader
must first of all guard against a very common and,
for a modern, very natural mistake. He must remember
that the interest of the piece is intended
to centre, not on Phaedra, but on Hippolytus. The
main interest of the plot is the struggle between
asceticism and self-gratification, as personified in
the maiden Artemis and the sensual Aphrodite.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Phaedra is only made to fall in love with Hippolytus
in order that he may reject her advances,
and thereby irritate her into working his ruin. As
has already been pointed out, she is dragged into a
quarrel which does not concern her, for a purpose
which does not interest her personally in the least.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, the reader will be able to
understand that combination of passionate desire
and cold-blooded reasoning which marks the utterances
of Phaedra. She has come to the conclusion,
she says at last (l. 391 <i>seqq.</i>), that love is an irresistible
disease; and since her position as a married
woman makes impossible the only means of cure
with which she is acquainted, she decides that, <i>for
the sake of her husband and children</i>, she had better
die. She will never dishonour her children, for,
next to money, there is nothing so valuable as a
good name.</p>

<p>To this the Nurse replies (l. 433 <i>seqq.</i>) that of
course love is irresistible, and there is only one way
to cure it; but she points out that this way may
perfectly well be adopted. The fact that Phaedra
is married need not be any obstacle, for husbands
are used to seeing more than they say.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“ἀλλ’, ὦ φίλη παῖ, λῆγε μὲν κακῶν φρενῶν,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">τάδ’ ἐστὶ, κρείσσω δαιμόνων εἶναι θέλειν,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Leave the matter to me, and if women can’t effect a
cure, perhaps men can.”</p>

<p>Phaedra protests. The Nurse answers with a little
very natural impatience (l. 490)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“τί σεμνομυθεῖς; οὐ λόγων εὐσχημόνων</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">δεῖ σ’, ἀλλὰ τἀνδρός.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Phaedra admits this, but insists that it would be
more respectable to die. The Nurse, however, persuades
her to try a love-potion first, and with this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
excuse leaves her to look for Hippolytus. Hippolytus,
as one knows, rejects the Nurse’s proposals,
and Phaedra takes refuge in suicide, making, as she
dies, one last desperate attempt to save her own
good name at the expense of the man she is supposed
to love (l. 715).</p>

<p>This, then, is the story of Phaedra. Where in all
this is there a trace of what we now call love?
Where is there a single expression of affection for
Hippolytus, a single expression to show that she
thinks of him otherwise than of one who has done
her a great and irretrievable injury? She seems to
think of him as one would think of a man from
whom one had caught the cholera. “Love is all
bitterness,” she says (l. 349); “and he is the cause.”
The catastrophe comes, and she walks off quietly
to murder him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“ὥστ’ εὐκλεᾶ μὲν παισὶ προσθεῖναι βίον,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">αὐτή τ’ ὄνασθαι πρὸς τὰ νῦν πεπτωκότα.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If this is love, the world must be a poorer place
than I gave it credit for.</p>

<p>Then follows the great argument between Hippolytus
and his father, which to the Athenians was
doubtless the chief point of the play. On the
speech of Theseus we need not dwell, though it is
perhaps just worth noticing the way in which he
enunciates, as a sort of great discovery which his
own experience and observation have enabled him
to make, the theory that it is possible for the
initiative in a criminal liaison to come from the side
of the man (l. 966 <i>seqq.</i>).</p>

<p>The answer of Hippolytus, however, is well worth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
study. For the first 24 of his 52 lines he describes
in general terms his own blameless character, and
it is only at the 25th that he condescends to discuss
the particular incident. “But you do not perhaps
believe all this about my chastity,” he says (l. 1007);
“but do tell me, then, what was the temptation in
this particular instance? Was this woman’s body
so especially beautiful? (1½ lines.) Or did I wish
by my conduct to become your heir? (2½ lines.)
Or to become king? (3 lines.) Surely you know
my only interest is in athletics.” (5 lines.) Then,
having finished the arguments which he is able to
bring forward, he proceeds to swear, and so concludes.
In other words, in a speech of 52 lines,
the suggestion that he might have been in love
with Phaedra, even in the most rudimentary sense
of the words, is contemptuously dismissed in a line
and a half, and no one seems to think that this
part of the subject ought to have been treated at
greater length. Now this one fact seems to me in
itself almost a sufficient proof that “romantic” ideas,
even as they were understood at the end of the
fourth century, were utterly foreign to Euripides.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>To come to another play. There are probably
few things in all literature so strange, not to say
comic, to modern ideas, as the relations between
Achilles and Iphigeneia in the <i>Iphigeneia in Aulis</i>.</p>

<p>Clytemnestra has been trapped into bringing her
daughter to Aulis, on promise of marriage with
Achilles, and when, in the scene which begins at
l. 801, she discovers the truth, she appeals to him
for protection. Achilles, “the nearest approach
to a modern gentleman of all the Greek tragic
characters,”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> replies as follows (l. 919 <i>seqq.</i>):</p>

<p>“I am a person of the highest breeding, and
therefore you may trust me to give you the correct
answer under the circumstances. Your daughter,
having been betrothed to me, shall not be killed;
it would reflect discredit on me if she were, and
that I cannot permit. No one shall so much as
touch the hem of her garment. <i>It is not, of course,
for her sake that I undertake to do this</i>, but because
I consider that Agamemnon has treated me shamefully.
He used my name to trap you into coming
here without asking my consent; <i>of course I should
have allowed him to use it if he had asked me</i>, for I
always put patriotism before everything; but he did
not ask me. I feel grossly insulted, and he will
touch Iphigeneia at his peril.”</p>

<p>“Your sentiments, Achilles,” remarks the Chorus,
“are worthy alike of you and of your divine
descent.”</p>

<p>“How can I thank you enough,” replies Clytemnestra,
“for all the trouble you have promised to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
take in this matter, which cannot interest you
personally in the least?”</p>

<p>There is a moment’s pause; then she suggests
timidly, “But would you like the girl to come to
you herself?”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” exclaims Achilles with horror.
“How can you suggest anything so improper?”
Then after a little he adds, “You must first of all
go and argue the case with Agamemnon.”</p>

<p>“Why that?” asks Clytemnestra. “There is no
chance there.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” he answers, “but still I wish you
to try; <i>for I should very much prefer, if possible,
that my name should be kept out of the business
altogether</i>.”</p>

<p>“What you say does you credit,” she answers.
“I will do my best to obey you.”</p>

<p>For the modern reader who studies this scene,
and then leans back and thinks a little what he
would have done or thought in Achilles’ place,
comment is, I imagine, superfluous.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Or look at Andromache’s speech in the <i>Andromache</i>.
(l. 184 <i>seqq.</i>) She is accused of occupying
too high a place in the favour of Neoptolemus. “Tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
me,” she answers to Hermione, “what reason could I
possibly have for wishing to stand well with your
husband? Do I wish to reign in your place, or to
have more children, or to make my children kings?
Or what reason could he possibly have for preferring
me? Is my native city so powerful? Have I such
influential friends?” &amp;c. &amp;c. As in the <i>Hippolytus</i>,
the idea that there may be love on either side is
dismissed without discussion.</p>

<p>Or look at the character of the Autourgos in the
<i>Electra</i>. He has married Electra, but refuses to touch
her, and why?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">αἰσχύνομαι γὰρ ὀλβίων ἀνδρῶν τέκνα</div>

<p>He is distressed that the daughter of such wealthy
parents should have made so poor a match. It is pity
for the house of Agamemnon that affects him, not
pity for Electra.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Hecuba again, in the play that bears her name,
does not think that it is much use to appeal to the
“romantic” feelings of Agamemnon.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">καὶ μὴν ἴσως μὲν τοῦ λόγου κενὸν τόδε,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Κύπριν προβάλλείν κ.τ.λ. (l. 824.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Phoenissae</i> there is not much love lost between
Antigone and Haemon (cp. l. 1672 <i>seqq.</i>). In
the <i>Orestes</i> the only incident which causes Pylades to
take the slightest interest in Electra is her suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
that they should murder Hermione. (l. 1191 <i>seqq.</i>)
In the <i>Helena</i> the first exclamation of Menelaus,
when his wife assures him that she has really been
faithful to him all the time, is, “How can you prove
it?”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In the <i>Medea</i> again the absence of the love-element
is a distinct loss. No one can doubt that the
character of Medea would have gained at once in
probability and in pathos, if she had been allowed to
recur, if only for a moment, to the memory of her
early love for Jason.</p>

<p>If more plays had been preserved, it would, doubtless,
have been easy still further to multiply instances;
but what has been said already is perhaps enough to
show that the romantic element in Euripides is really
most conspicuous by its absence. And this cannot
be a surprise to anyone who cares to go to the root
of the matter. That relation between men and
women which we call the “romantic” is founded
upon sentiments and ideas which are entirely distinct
from the sexual emotions. Euripides, as we have had
occasion to notice again and again, though he had
carefully studied the sexual instinct in all its workings,
had never been able to conceive of a relation between
man and woman which had not this for its basis.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Without pure—I had almost said Platonic—love for
its fundamental principle, romance is an impossibility.
The romantic Alexandrian writers may not have themselves
loved purely, but they knew what pure love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
was, and such love was their ideal. With Euripides it
was not so, and this one fact is enough to show that
he belongs to the old literature and not to the new.
That Euripides, by the emphasis which he laid on
the female character, contributed largely towards
preparing men’s minds for the growth of romance
and what we now call love, cannot be denied;
but that he himself had more than the very faintest
glimmerings of what such love really was, cannot be
maintained by anyone who has ever read his works.</p>

<p class="tb">And here we may close this first part of our enquiry.
The foregoing examination of the Greek writers,
though it has made no mention of various well-known
names, has yet been for our present purpose a practically
complete one. Pindar was prevented by the
nature of his works from dealing to any large extent
with the position of women or their relations with
men;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and even where he has an opportunity of so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
doing (as, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Fr.</i> 122), the result is very disappointing,
especially in view of his Boeotian origin. The fragments
of the early tragedians, other than the three
discussed, are strangely deficient in references to
women. Nor need the old Attic Comedy detain us.
The general spirit of this thoroughly Athenian
product is sufficiently summed up in what profess
to be the earliest words of it extant, the fragment of
Susario,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀκούετε λεῴ· Σουσαρίων λέγει τάδε,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">υἱὸς Φιλίνον Μεγαρόθεν Τριποδίσκιος·</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">κακὸν γυναίκες,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while it may be doubted whether in the whole course
of this literature a female character was ever introduced
on the stage, except with the view of leading
up to some form of indecency.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The net results of this examination, though chiefly
negative, are yet fairly clear. It has, I hope, been
shown that—</p>

<p>(1) That relation between men and women which
is now called “love” was, as far as can be gathered
from literature, non-existent among the Greeks down
to the end of the fifth century.</p>

<p>(2) The position occupied by women in the consideration
of men was so unimportant, that even the
sensual relation of the sexes was but little treated of
in literature till a comparatively late period, and was
always, down to the end of the fifth century, looked
upon by a considerable section of society as unfitted
for public discussion and representation. In other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
words, love-poetry in the modern sense is non-existent
in classical Greek literature; while love-poetry
in any sense, addressed to women, is a far
more insignificant element in that literature than is
commonly supposed.</p>

<p>That what has just been said does not hold good
of the “Alexandrian” poets is so obvious that it
hardly needs to be stated. Equally true, however,
and not equally obvious, is the fact that, from the
very first, these writers talk of women and women’s
love in an entirely different tone to that adopted by
those of whom we have hitherto been speaking.
The line of cleavage between, say, Asclepiades and
Euripides, is in reality quite as marked as that
between Euripides and Apollonius. On this subject,
therefore, it is perhaps worth while to say a few
words, though the terribly mutilated condition in
which the works of the earlier Alexandrians
especially have come down to us, makes it very
difficult to point to striking examples of what has
been said.</p>

<p>The first representatives of the “Alexandrian”
school of poets—that is, of the school of women-lovers—are
Asclepiades and Philetas;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and in both
cases the mere nature of their works (quite apart
from their tone) is sufficiently striking when compared
with the literature that had gone before.</p>

<p>Whether Philetas actually gave the title of Battis
to a collection of his poems is difficult to say—it
is, perhaps, on the whole, not improbable that he
did—but in any case there can be no doubt that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
considerable number of his elegies were either actually
addressed to Battis, or else treated of her. The
erudite and elaborate style of these poems is equally
indisputable. Now, whatever may have been the
actual tone of address in these elegies—the fragments
unfortunately tell us nothing, and such other
evidence as there is on the subject is of the scantiest
description<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>—the two facts above-mentioned form of
themselves a combination quite without parallel in
the Greek literature of which we have hitherto
been speaking. That anyone should have taken
the trouble to devote erudition and elaboration to
the praise of a woman, would have been an unheard-of
thing in early Greece.</p>

<p>Asclepiades is an equally striking figure in the
early Alexandrian literature; for it was he who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the first to introduce woman-love into the epigram—the
first, in fact, to give it that social recognition
which we have seen already accorded to boy-love,
well-nigh two centuries before.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>But what renders Asclepiades particularly important
for us just now—far more so than Philetas—is
the fact that some forty of his epigrams have been
preserved, and that it will therefore be possible, by
examining these, to study at close quarters the
points in which the tone of this new love-poetry
differs from that of the old.</p>

<p>In the epigrams of Asclepiades we find, for the
first time, love for a woman spoken of as a matter
of life and death:—</p>

poems like <i>Anth. Pal.</i> v. 189, xii. 153.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Still more
striking, to those who remember the brutality of
Epicrates’ attack upon Lais,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> is the tone in which
the aged courtesan is spoken of in <i>Anth. Pal.</i> vii. 217.
The two little pictures of happy lovers, so suggestive
of the Acme and Septimius of Catullus, in <i>Anth. Pal.</i>
v. 153, xii. 105, are also very far indeed away from
anything of the kind that had ever gone before.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>We are thus confronted by a very remarkable fact.
That way of regarding women which we may call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the romantic feeling—a feeling which we have noticed
to be conspicuous by its absence in Euripides—appears
suddenly developed to a high degree, in what is
practically the first poetry extant after him. The full
meaning of this fact we shall come to consider later;
but before it is possible to do this, it will be necessary
to institute some further preliminary enquiries.</p>

<p class="tb">Attention has already been sufficiently drawn to
the almost entire absence from the early Greek
literature of love-poetry of any kind addressed to
women; at the same time, it has been briefly pointed
out more than once that love-poetry addressed to
boys or men is a very common phenomenon in this
literature. This mere fact in itself would be one
requiring some investigation, in an examination of
this kind; but when the nature of this love-poetry
comes to be considered, it will be seen how particularly
important, in the present connection, is this
phase of the Greek mind. For it is a fact which
becomes immediately apparent, and grows more and
more evident, the more the matter is looked into,
that while such little love-poetry as does exist,
addressed by men to women, is entirely concerned
with the purely sensual aspect of the matter, in the
very considerable volume of poetry addressed by
men to men, this aspect is well-nigh entirely ignored.
But obvious though this fact must be to everyone
who reads the early Greek poetry with open eyes,
the influence of our present methods of thought and
training has been so strong, that not only has its
importance been strangely ignored by modern
writers, but even the fact itself has been questioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
or denied. Under these circumstances, it will not be
superfluous to go into the matter at some length, for
reasons which will appear more clearly when the
truth has been established.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The story of the <i>Iliad</i> is a story without a heroine,
a feature which makes it well-nigh unique among
national legends. This fact has struck various people,
and has been accounted for in various ways, the
favourite explanation, perhaps, being that the Greek
imagination was severer and more self-controlled,
more statuesque, one may almost say, than that of
other primitive peoples, and was therefore content
with a hero whose sole inspiration lay in love of
glory and love of battle, apart from any gentler
emotion whatever.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> This estimate of the Greek
imagination is no doubt a just one, but there is none
the less a strong objection to seeking in it an explanation
of the peculiarities of the <i>Iliad</i>. To regard
the Achilles of Homer as a person animated solely
by ambition and military enthusiasm, is, in face of
the facts of the case, impossible. As is well known,
Achilles sulks because deprived of Briseis, and is
only roused again by the death of Patroclus; that is
to say, his two main actions are influenced entirely
by motives outside of those which are looked upon
as his chief characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In other words, Achilles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
is not a military hero at all; the interest one feels in
him is due almost entirely to the emotional side of
his character. But while this much is clear, the
question still remains: Why has this emotional hero
no corresponding heroine? for, of course, one cannot
regard Briseis as such.</p>

<p>The answer to this is one that will not please a
certain class of modern minds, but that is no proof
that it is not true. There is a heroine in the <i>Iliad</i>,
and that heroine is Patroclus. The Achilleis is a
story of which the main motive is the love of Achilles
for Patroclus.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This solution is astoundingly simple,
and yet it took me so long to bring myself to accept it,
that I am quite ready to forgive anyone who feels a
similar hesitation. But those who do accept it, cannot
fail to observe, on further consideration, how thoroughly
suitable a motive of this kind would be in a national
Greek epic. For this is the motive running through
the whole of Greek life, till that life was transmuted
by the influence of Macedonia. The lover-warriors
Achilles and Patroclus are the direct spiritual ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of the Sacred Band of Thebans, who died to a man
on the field of Chaeronea.</p>

<p>Those who have made any study of the social life
of early Greece, will hardly need to be reminded how
important a part this relationship between older and
younger men played there. In some states, such as
Megara, it was specially patronised by the government.
Among the Cretans, and to a certain extent
also among the Lacedaemonians,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> it formed the basis
of the military organisation.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> At Thespiae, the festival
of the Erotidia was consecrated to this form of love.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
At Elis there was a periodical beauty-competition
among the youths, the prizes consisting of arms and
armour.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> A somewhat similar contest took place
every spring at the tomb of the hero Diocles at
Megara.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Nor was this all. In many states this
relationship came to be looked upon as well-nigh an
emblem of constitutional liberty;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> so much so, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the tyrants used to regard it as a standing menace to
themselves, and actually took steps to suppress it.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Thus Polycrates destroyed the gymnasium<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> at Samos
ὥσπερ ἀντιτείχισμα τῇ ἰδίᾳ ἀκροπόλει, and others are
said to have behaved in a similar way.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>But while the social importance of this relationship
cannot be questioned, its character is equally unmistakable.
In principle, and also in practice, it was
pure. Its first and most striking feature, a feature
specially emphasised by almost every ancient writer
who alludes at all to the subject, is its perfect purity.
The very idea of sensuality in connection with it is
almost invariably vigorously repudiated,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and the
author of the “Erotic Oration” of Demosthenes is
but expressing the universal convictions of his predecessors
when he says, δίκαιος ἐραστὴς οὔτ’ ἂν
ποιήσειεν οὐδὲν αἰσχρὸν οὔτ’ ἀξιώσειεν.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>How entirely this was the case will be still more
apparent when we come to examine the writers who
dealt with the subject. Here it may suffice to remark
that, apart from that main sewer, the Old Attic
Comedy, there are, in all the Greek poetry extant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
down to the end of the fifth century, but a couple,
or at most three, passages in which sensuality is so
much as suggested in this connection.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>To trace the growth and development of this form
of love—for love it was in the most modern sense of
the word—would be extremely interesting; but it
would be a long and difficult undertaking, which
cannot be attempted here. The main outlines of its
history are, however, sufficiently clear. Originating
in the companionship of the battle-field, where the
younger and weaker combatants would naturally
look to their elders for help and support, it introduced
itself also, as we have seen, into those peaceful
exercises which serve to train the soldier; and hence,
as soon as we find civilised communities, we find both
the army and the gymnasium organised with reference
to it. When a somewhat more settled condition of
affairs had succeeded to the constant warfare of
earlier times, we find it losing to some extent its
distinctively military character, though this never
entirely disappears, as is clear from the institution by
Epaminondas of that “Sacred Band” of which we
have had occasion to speak already. And so, in
peace and war alike, it continues throughout classical
times a dominating element in Greek society. Its
highest development was due, of course, to Socrates
and his followers; but from the end of the fifth
century onwards it was beginning to lose its hold
upon the Greek mind. The improved position of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
women, and that improved way of regarding them
which was gradually springing up about this time,
could not fail to affect it prejudicially, while other
equally potent causes were at work to bring about its
overthrow; indeed, it is not long before we find
writers speaking in open disparagement of it.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> And
in all probability this contempt for the “hypocrisy of
the philosophers” was now, to a great extent, justified;
for there is little reason to suppose that at this period
that high standard of moral purity, with which this
form of love had been originally associated, was any
longer a prominent feature of it. The Macedonians,
in destroying the old Greek states, were destroying
at once the home of its birth and the cause of its
existence. It is small wonder that it failed, like so
many other of the old Greek institutions, to adapt
itself to its new surroundings, and that it could not
survive the downfall of those virtues of patriotism
and independence of which it was at once the outcome
and the emblem.</p>

<p>But the fragrance of its early purity and beauty
was never quite lost, as long as the classical world
remained. In well-nigh all the poetry dealing with it
there is a tone of dignity and chivalry to which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
poetry addressed to women never, perhaps, wholly
attained. The charming grace of the 12th Idyll of
Theocritus is unsurpassed in any of his other works;
the passionate despair of the 23rd is unequalled. The
contrast in tone between the 12th and the 5th books
of the <i>Anthology</i> is one of the most remarkable
features of that remarkable collection of poems.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
Even Catullus, when striving to give expression to
a love purer and more intense than any Roman had
ever known, still feels the spell of early Greece upon
him.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“tunc te dilexi, non tantum ut vulgus amicam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">sed pater ut natos diligit et generos,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he exclaims. “I loved you, not as a man loves a
woman, but as a man loves a youth!”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>We have hitherto been speaking chiefly of the
social aspect of this form of love; we can now
proceed to examine somewhat more in detail its
influence upon literature. And here two striking
facts will at once present themselves to us, the exact
converse of those which met us when examining the
early literary treatment of woman-love. From the
earliest period onwards we shall find the love of man
for man taking a prominent place in poetry, while
at the same time this love as there depicted is
remarkable for its chivalrous and unsensual character.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
In other words, while the love of man to woman was
among the early Greeks a love of the senses, the
love of man to man was a love of the soul.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Iliad</i> we have spoken already, and we need
not speak further, for though, as we have already
pointed out, the relations between various of the
Greek heroes there described are strong presumptive
evidence of a state of affairs parallel to that which
we know to have existed in historical times,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> it is in
the nature of an epic to be unable to supply proof
of so positive a kind as is to be found in lyric poetry,
which is generally, anyhow in early times, the expression
of the writer’s actual feelings with reference
to actual surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p>In dealing with the lyric writers we shall therefore
be on firmer ground.</p>

<p>Here, in the fragments of Archilochus already we
find very strong evidence of the existence of love-poems
addressed to men; indeed, it is impossible
satisfactorily to explain <i>Fr.</i> 85—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀλλά μ’ ὁ λυσιμελής, ὦ ’ταῖρε, δάμναται πόθος,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">on any other supposition. This being so, and there
being no evidence of any erotic poems addressed to
women, it is justifiable to consider that <i>Fr.</i> 84 also
belonged to this same class of poetry<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>; while there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
is further no reason to believe that these two passages
were unique in the works of Archilochus. In other
words, love-poems addressed to men are among
the earliest known forms of subjective Greek
poetry.</p>

<p>But while both Archilochus and Alcman<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> produced
works of this kind, the fragments of these which
remain are too scanty for it to be possible to feel any
real certainty as to their exact nature; nor again
was either of these two authors particularly celebrated
in ancient times for this class of composition.</p>

<p>It is different with Alcaeus. Alcaeus was recognised
throughout antiquity as the master <i>par excellence</i>
of this form of poetry, and though the actual
fragments of his works on this subject which remain
are not much more satisfactory than is the case with
his predecessors, we have most valuable evidence as
to their nature in two poems of Theocritus, the one
professedly and the other evidently imitated from
them.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> These poems contain certain evidently Alexandrian
elements,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and, consequently, it would be
unjustifiable to press any particular detail of them
as illustrating Alcaeus, but, at the same time, there
seems every reason to believe that in their general
tone they reflect the spirit of their originals, and it
is to their general tone that I wish to draw the
reader’s attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>To take the first of them (<i>Idyll</i> xxix.). The
speaker is about to tell some unpleasant truths, but
he feels constrained to apologise for so doing (1-4).
After a passionate but dignified protestation of his
love (5-8), he appeals to his friend’s better feelings
(9), and urges him to be constant in his affections
(10-20).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ποίησαι καλιὰν μίαν εἰν ἑνὶ δενδρίῳ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ὅπᾳ μηδὲν ἀπίξεται ἄγριον ὄρπετον.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“If you do so,” he continues—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“ἀγαθὸς μὲν ἀκούσεαι</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἐξ ἀστῶν,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and Love will deal kindly with you, and save you
from such pangs as I have suffered (21-24). For
we grow older every day, and youth is the season
for forming those friendships which last a lifetime
(25-34). Now, I would readily do anything for your
sake, but if you disregard my words, the time may
come when even if you call me I will not answer”
(35-40).</p>

<p>But anyone who has ever read this charming little
poem will not need to have its character further
forced upon him. The manliness, the dignity, the
courtesy of it, are patent in every line; more striking
still to those who know Greek literature is the spirit
of self-negation which pervades the whole; and all
this, combined with a passion which is none the less
real because it is kept rigorously under control.
Even in Alexandrian times it would be hard to find
a poem addressed to a woman which can equal this
in its chivalrous tone; to look for such a poem in
early Greek literature would be vain indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>In the second of these two pieces (<i>Idyll</i> xxx.),
also in all probability modelled on Alcaeus, the
purely erotic side of the matter comes more to the
front than in the one we have just been discussing,
but here, too, one cannot fail to be struck by the
quiet earnestness of the tone, which is as far removed
from the good-humoured banter of Asclepiades as it
is from the outspoken brutality of Archilochus.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most striking commentary on this
state of feeling is that furnished by the other section
of the Lesbian school of poets. It has troubled
the minds of many modern commentators to think
why Sappho should have addressed love-poems to
Anactoria; for those who have formed a true idea of
what “love” between a man and a woman meant in
Greece of the seventh century, and compared this
with the love then existing among men for one
another, the question answers itself. Sappho, in
addressing love-poems to Anactoria, was but adapting
to her own circumstances and sex the universal
contemporary principles of love-poetry. It seemed
so unnatural then, and so impossible, to connect
the sexual instinct with any pure or noble feeling,
that Sappho, because her love was pure and
its ideal a noble one, instinctively and inevitably
chose as the object of this love her fellow-women,
just as the men of her time chose their fellow-men.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
To the Greek of the period the association of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
sexes inevitably suggested sensuality; Sappho loved
Anactoria, just as Alcaeus loved Lycus, in order that
this suggestion might be as far as possible excluded.
Sappho loved a woman because her love was too
pure to allow her to love a man. All this sounds
strange—monstrous almost—to modern ears; and yet,
of all the scandal of the centuries which has heaped
itself up around the name of Lesbos, what Sappho
herself would have resented most would perhaps have
been the story that she was in love with Phaon.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to notice that
Anacreon, while he was the originator of love-poetry
addressed to women, at the same time addressed a
large number of his poems, in fact, the majority, to
boys. In his case, therefore, it is possible for the
first time to compare the two forms of “love” in the
same individual. The comparison is not much to
the advantage of the newer feeling. While the outspoken
sensuality of the poems devoted to women
cannot be matter of dispute, even judging from such
fragments of them as remain, the chaste and sober
nature of Anacreon’s relation to his boy-lovers is not
only a feature of the extant fragments, but is also
alluded to more than once by ancient writers, who
had his complete works from which to draw their
inferences. Thus Aelian (<i>Var. Hist.</i> ix. 4), speaking
of the love of Anacreon for Smerdias (cp. Anacreon,
<i>Fr.</i> 48) says—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>εἶτα ἥσθη τὸ μειράκιον τῷ ἐπαίνῳ καὶ τὸν Ἀνακρέοντα
ἠσπάζετο σεμνῶς εὖ μάλα, ἐρῶντα τῆς ψυχῆς, ἀλλ’ οὐ τοῦ
σώματος. μὴ γάρ τις ἡμῖν διαβαλλέτω, πρὸς θεῶν, τὸν
ποιητὴν τὸν Τήϊον, μηδ’ ἀκόλαστον εἶναι λεγέτω.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>Maximus Tyrius again, who several times alludes
to Anacreon (and always under the title of ὁ σοφός
or ὁ σοφιστής), expressly compares his love to that
of Socrates (xxiv. 9)—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>ἡ δὲ τοῦ Τηΐου σοφιστοῦ τέχνη τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἤθους καὶ τρόπου,
καὶ γὰρ πάντων ἐρᾷ τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἐπαινεῖ πάντας. μεστὰ δὲ
αὐτοῦ τὰ ᾄσματα τής Σμερδίου κόμης καὶ τῶν Κλεοβούλου
ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ τῆς Βαθύλλου ὥρας· ἀλλὰ κὰν τούτοις τὴν
σωφροσύνην ὅρα. ἔραμαι δέ τοι κ.τ.λ. (<i>Fr.</i> 44) καὶ αὖθις,
καλὸν εἶναι τῷ ἐρῶντι τὰ δίκαια φησί.</p>

</div>

<p>A similar compliment to Anacreon seems to
glimmer through Athenaeus’ account of Polycrates,
(xii. 540 E.)</p>

<p>How deep the difference really went, it is of course
impossible, in the absence of the poet’s complete
works, to show, but, as already remarked, even in the
few fragments we have, the distinction between the
strong passion with which he speaks of his boy-loves
and the frivolous tone of his addresses to women is
very noticeable.</p>

<p>On the deep significance of the attempt of Ibycus
to introduce personal erotic poetry into the choral
hymns, we have also dwelt,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> so that we can proceed
without further delay to the works which bear the
name of Theognis, a body of poems which, in the
present connection, are perhaps the most interesting
in all early Greek literature.</p>

<p>The great mass of these poems are in the form of
short pieces addressed by the writer to his youthful
friend Cyrnus, and, as such, are one long commentary
on the subject we are discussing. Regarded from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
this point of view, several features at once force
themselves upon the attention. Notwithstanding the
fact that many of them are thorough love-poems, yet
not only is the sensual side of the matter entirely
ignored, but even the erotic, as far as that is subjective,
is kept rigorously in the background. The
counsel Theognis gives is such as a father might
give to his son—<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Much more there is, similar in tone, chiefly advice
as to the choice of friends and the like, but it would
be an endless task to examine all this in detail. The
reader may open the collection at random, and at
once find further proof of what has been said here.
Whatever the subject of the poems and whatever
their occasion, they are all well-nigh equally remarkable
for their dignity, their temperance, their
manliness, and for their most un-Greek virtue of
unselfishness, and remarkable, no less, for the
absence from them of that meanness and spitefulness
which even in modern times so often mark the
unfortunate lover. It does one good to read these
poems; they are keen and clear like a mouthful of
mountain air; and it does one good, too, to think of
the θοῖναι καὶ εἰλάπιναι where they were sung and
where the spirit of them was understood. After all,
modern writers may decry and defame these <i>amantes
contra naturam</i> as much as they please, but they
cannot deny that they were the first to teach that
the mission of love was to make men better.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>The intimate connection between the poems that
bear the name of Theognis and the <i>Scolia</i> has already
been noticed; it will not therefore be surprising to
find that the latter are almost as full as the former of
references to our present subject, though, as it is in
their nature to be commonplace, they need not detain
us long.</p>

<p>Of the 25 <i>Scolia</i> preserved by Athenaeus,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> 15 deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
with friendships of this kind;<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> these may be roughly
divided into two classes: those which sing the praises
of famous pairs of friends, and those which contain
general remarks on the subject. A striking instance
of the first class is, of course, the well-known <i>Scolion</i>
of Callistratus (9-12), in which it may be observed
that in the second verse, where Harmodius is promised
immortality among the celebrated heroes of
antiquity, the two of these specially mentioned are
Achilles, the lover of Patroclus, and Diomed, the
lover of Sthenelus. Other examples are <i>Scol.</i> 21,
referring to Admetus, and <i>Scol.</i> 17, 18 referring to
Ajax, the latter of whom is a hero in the <i>Scolia</i>
as early as the time of Alcaeus. In the second
class, perhaps the most interesting are <i>Scol.</i> 23, with
its very Theognis-like advice, and <i>Scol.</i> 19, of which
we have already spoken.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>As is, of course, only to be expected, these poems
do not add much to our knowledge of the subject
or its treatment; but it was none the less worth
while to call attention to them, owing to the fact
that verse or doggerel of this kind, though it may
not be of much importance itself, is yet able to
furnish important evidence as to the nature of the
popular feeling to which it owes its origin. The
views expressed in these poems are not those of
individual authors, they are the views of the whole
community; and it is this fact which gives to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
<i>Scolia</i> a far deeper significance than would at first
sight appear to belong to them.</p>

<p>So far, the examination of such fragments of the
early Greek literature as have survived, has resulted
in the discovery of a body of evidence which, if not
very voluminous, is yet remarkably unanimous. It
remains to be seen in how far it is possible to supplement
this from the works of the Attic tragedians,
which have been preserved in a more perfect condition.
At the first glance the prospect is not very
promising; love altogether, as we have seen, plays
a very subordinate part in the Attic drama, while
that form of love which we are immediately considering,
seems at first sight to be especially neglected.
And indeed, to a certain extent, this is really the
case, for very obvious reasons. In the early days
of tragedy, when the love-element was well-nigh
entirely excluded, in obedience to the then artistic
canons, it was not to be expected that exception
would be made in favour of this particular form of
it;<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> later, when the love-element was gradually
forcing itself into the drama, the playwrights were
all, whether they cared to confess it or not, under
the influence of Euripides, who, as we know, was
a special student of feminine nature, and as such, felt
only a qualified interest in the mutual relations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
men.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But at the same time, a closer examination
of the Attic tragedians will perhaps reveal that this
characteristically Greek emotion has had a greater
influence on their work than one would, at the first
moment, be disposed to believe.</p>

<p>Two plays, the <i>Myrmidones</i> of Aeschylus and the
<i>Niobe</i> of Sophocles, are specially mentioned by
Athenaeus<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> as introducing ἀρσενικοὶ ἔρωτες; unfortunately,
however, in neither case are the fragments
preserved of a kind to throw much light on the
method of treatment adopted.</p>

<p>The <i>Myrmidones</i>, which seems to have been the
first play of a trilogy, treated of the death of
Patroclus and Achilles’ lament for him,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> which
seems, to judge by such expressions as those preserved
in <i>Fr.</i> 135,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> 138, to have been of a passionate
character; but whether the erotic element was the
only interest in the play, and whether it was in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
way developed in the latter part of the trilogy, it is
impossible now to say. The <i>Niobe</i> recounted the
misfortunes of that heroine, with her subsequent
grief and exile from Thebes, the scene of the
tragedy, to Lydia. But a striking feature, the most
striking, perhaps, if we may draw any inference
from the statement in Athenaeus<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> that this play
was commonly known as ἡ τραγῳδία ἡ παιδεράστρια,
was the relation represented as existing among
Niobe’s sons.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This would appear to have been
especially emphasised in the account of the death-scene<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>—a
passage which we can gather indirectly
to have been the most popular in the play;<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> whether
it was at all prominent in the previous action we
cannot tell; and, indeed, the fragments of the <i>Niobe</i>
are of a quite particularly meagre description.</p>

<p>To these two plays mentioned by Athenaeus
must be added a third, the <i>Chrysippus</i> of Euripides,
a work which is peculiarly interesting for two
reasons—its author and its subject. The <i>Myrmidones</i>
and the <i>Niobe</i>, of which we have just spoken, seem,
as far as can be judged by the little of them that
remains, to have dealt with what may be called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
simple straightforward love-stories. Men are introduced
as in love with other men, and this love is
brought to a climax by the most usual of expedients—the
death of the loved object. Euripides, on the
other hand, was, as we have seen, above all things
a student of the emotions in their more complex
phases, and a <i>dénouement</i> of so ordinary a kind could
not have failed to appear commonplace to a writer
who took such an interest in the pathology of the
senses, even when he for once abandoned his favourite
field of the feminine passions, and undertook the examination
of a form of love, the symptoms of which
are notoriously more easily capable of diagnosis.
And, as a matter of fact, the <i>Chrysippus</i> introduces us
to a novel and most interesting side of the question.
The story on which the play is founded is, to quote
the words of the Argument to the <i>Phoenissae</i>, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>οὗτος (ὁ Λάϊος) ἀφικόμενός ποτε εἰς Ἦλιν καὶ τὸν τοῦ
Πέλοπος υἱὸν Χρύσιππον ἰδών, ὃς ἦν ἐξ ἄλλης αὐτῷ γυναικὸς
καὶ οὐκ ἐκ τῆς θυγατρὸς Οἰνομάου Ἱπποδαμείας, καὶ ἁλοὺς
τούτου κατάκρας τῷ ἔρωτι, ἁρπάσας εἰς Θήβας ἤνεγκεν. καὶ
συνῆν αὐτῷ τὰ ἐρωτικὰ πρῶτος ἐν ἀνθρώποις τὴν ἀρρενοφθορίαν
εὑρών, καθὼς δὴ καὶ ὁ Ζεὺς ἐν θεοῖς τὸν Γανυμήδην ἁρπάσας.
ὁ δὲ Πέλοψ μαθὼν τοῦτο κατηράσατο Λάϊῳ μηδέποτε μὲν
παῖδα τεκεῖν, εἰ δ’ ἄρα καὶ συμβαίη, ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τοῦτον
ἀναιρεθήσεσθαι.</p>

</div>

<p>Or, according to a slightly different version found in
“Peisander”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>ἱστορεῖ Πείσανδρος, ὅτι κατὰ χόλον τῆς Ἥρας ἐπέμφθη ἡ
Σφὶγξ τοῖς Θηβαίοις ἀπὸ τῶν ἐσχάτων μερῶν τῆς Αἰθιοπίας,
ὅτι τὸν Λάϊον ἀσεβήσαντα εἰς τὸν παράνομον ἔρωτα τοῦ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Χρυσίππου, ὃν ἥρπασεν ἀπὸ τῆς Πίσης, οὐκ ἐτιμωρήσαντο
... πρῶτος δὲ ὁ Λάϊος τὸν ἀθέμιστον ἔρωτα τοῦτον ἔσχεν.
ὁ δὲ Χρύσιππος ὑπὸ αἰσχύνης ἑαυτὸν διεχρήσατο τῷ ξίφει.
(Schol. <i>ad Eur. Phoen.</i> 1760.)</p>

</div>

<p>The moral of both these stories is obvious. The
behaviour of Laius towards Chrysippus was a crime
deserving the most exemplary punishment.</p>

<p>Now this fact at once affords us a clue as to the
real nature of Laius’ conduct. It seems impossible
that the statement that Laius πρῶτος τὸν ἀθέμιστον
ἔρωτα τοῦτον ἔσχεν can be taken to mean that he
was the founder of love as between man and man
in the same way as this is related of, for instance,
Orpheus. It seems impossible to believe that any
legend should have described the originator of that
form of love with which, as we know, the highest
thoughts and ideals of the early Greeks were so
intimately associated, as a criminal worthy of divine
punishment. Euripides himself might not have
shrunk from such a course, but it does not seem
conceivable that he should have found any existing
legend on which to begin to work;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and it seems,
therefore, unquestionable that the meaning of the
story cannot have been this. As a matter of fact,
a careful examination of such evidence as we have,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
affords every reason for believing that its meaning
was a very different one.</p>

<p>The true meaning of the legend is this. Laius
was the first to violate the universal law that the
love between man and man must be pure; and it
was this transgression that involved himself, his
family, and his country in such universal ruin.</p>

<p>That this meaning is in itself a more likely one
than the other, will probably not be disputed by
anyone who has formed a true conception of early
Greek feeling on the subject; more than this one
cannot expect. But while actual proof on the point
is impossible, it may not be inapposite to draw
attention to the way in which the sensuality and
unreasoning animalism of Laius are emphasised at
every turn, with the view doubtless, in the first case,
of preventing any conceivable misunderstanding of
the true purport of the tradition.</p>

<p>In the play itself, the nature of his passion is
shown only too clearly by the famous distichs (<i>Fr.</i>
840, 841):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">λέληθεν οὐδὲν τῶνδέ μ’ ὧν σὺ νουθετεῖς,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">γνώμην δ’ ἔχοντά μ’ ἡ φύσις βιάζεται.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">αἰαῖ, τόδ’ ἤδη δεινὸν ἀνθρώποις κακόν,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ὅταν τις εἰδῇ τἀγαθόν, χρῆται δὲ μή.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cicero says as much (<i>Tusc.</i> iv. 33, 71): Quis ...
non intellegit quid apud Euripidem et loquatur et
cupiat Laius? Aelian, too (<i>N. H.</i> vi. 15), draws an
unconscious comparison between this play and the
pure old-Greek <i>Niobe</i> of Sophocles when, after
describing how the dolphin that loved a boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
ἐπιβιῶναι τοῖς παιδικοῖς οὐκ ἐτόλμησεν, he adds,
Λάϊος δὲ ἐπὶ Χρυσίππῳ, ὦ καλὲ Εὐριπίδη, τοῦτο οὐκ
ἔδρασεν.</p>

<p>The sensuality of the passion is clearly shown,
too, by various features of the legend as recorded
by various writers, above all by the fact that Hera
is the goddess outraged, and by the peculiar nature
of the curse of Pelops. The actual words, moreover,
of the Scholiast of the <i>Phoenissae</i> (τὸν Λάϊον
<span class="u">ἀσεβήσαντα</span> ἐς τὸν <span class="u">παράνομον</span> ἔρωτα τοῦ Χρυσίππου)
and of the argument of that play (καὶ <span class="u">συνῆν αὐτῷ</span>
τὰ ἐρωτικὰ πρῶτος ἐν ἀνθρώποις τὴν ἀρρενοφθορίαν
εὑρών), seem all to point the same way.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>In fact, the sensuality of Laius is made such a
feature of the story in every case in which it is
narrated, that it cannot well be doubted that this
sensuality was a feature of the story in its earliest
form; and if this be granted, there can be very little
question as to the meaning of the story itself, as
originally current.</p>

<p>We thus have three plays, one by each of the
great dramatists, dealing with this subject, two of
them dwelling upon the intense and unselfish nature
of the passion in its true form, the third emphasising
the disastrous consequences of any transgression of
that purity which was so integral a part of it; but
are these three the only ones of their kind? They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
are the only three, perhaps, that dealt with the
purely erotic side of the matter; but its general
influence evidently extended over a far wider field.
This influence makes itself felt in various ways and
in varying degrees, and it would be a lengthy task,
and one beside the present purpose, to endeavour
to trace its workings wherever they are visible in
Attic tragedy; but a few noticeable instances of it
are well worthy of attention.</p>

<p>One of these is the <i>Ajax</i> of Sophocles. It is a
common complaint against this play that the second
half of it is inferior in interest to the first. The
admirers of Sophocles, however, contend that, to an
Athenian audience, the details of funeral arrangements
were matters of such paramount importance
that, in a play intended for the Athenian stage, a
second act dealing entirely with this subject would
not by any means be of the nature of an anti-climax.
I am no great admirer of Sophocles, and
still less am I an admirer of the mob that pelted
Aeschylus and hooted Euripides, but yet I should
be disposed to give the Athenians credit for rather
higher tastes than this would seem to imply; while,
even had the predilections of his audience been so
strongly those of the undertaker, it might surely
have been hoped that a poet of Sophocles’ genius
would have had the courage to ignore them. Indeed,
as long as the interest of the second half of the
<i>Ajax</i> is considered as centred on the dead body of
the hero, it is impossible successfully to refute the
charge of bathos; but a more careful consideration
of this part of the play will, perhaps, show that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
interest is by no means intended to be attached in
this Mezentius-like manner to a corpse. The interest
is meant to centre on Teucer, the <i>amasius</i> of the
dead Ajax,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and on his efforts to prove himself
worthy of his heroic lover; for his lover’s sake, in
spite of every obstacle, and in the face of what looks
like certain death, he insists that due respect shall
be paid to the dead; in fact, there are in this
situation the germs of the situation which excites
such general interest in the <i>Antigone</i>.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> There the
character whose weakness is made strength through
love, is a woman, and so we moderns admire; here
it is a man, and so we misunderstand; but it does
not follow that the Greeks were equally narrow in
their sympathies.</p>

<p>Another instance, less obvious at first sight, but
equally convincing on nearer examination, is the
<i>Alcestis</i>. The <i>Alcestis</i> is a very difficult play to
understand, as far as the motives of its leading
figures are concerned; nor is it enough to say that,
because the play has been described as “something
of a satyric drama,” therefore all its characters are
meant to be grotesque. The self-concentration of
Admetus and the complete acquiescence therein of
Alcestis, must surely be capable of some more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
satisfactory explanation.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> This explanation is,
perhaps, to be found in the relation existing between
Admetus and Apollo. The story of the love of
Apollo for Admetus is sufficiently familiar,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and
has been alluded to on various occasions in the
preceding pages. Both at Athens and Sparta the
legend seems to have been well known,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and there
can be no doubt that an audience, when called upon
to listen to a play dealing with Admetus, would
instinctively call to mind this incident in his life.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
Granted this, it is not, perhaps, too bold to say that
it is equally unquestionable that this recollection
on their part must have influenced their view of the
hero’s character. He was unwilling to die; for any
Greek to be unwilling to die was excusable in a way
which we who live in English fogs can never understand;
but for Admetus, the beloved of the Sun-god!
If he, who for nine years had met Apollo face to
face, shrank from the mould and the mud of Hades,
what reason to wonder at it? To a Greek, to live
was to see the sun; surely then, to one whom the
Sun-god loved, life must be doubly precious, precious
to a degree that less happy mortals could never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
comprehend.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Then, again, if one thought of who
Admetus was. Surely the man whom the Sun-god
loved was a man whom the world could not spare,
a man for whom it was a privilege to be considered
worthy to die. Patriotism, too, no less than personal
affection, would seem to compel a sacrifice on behalf
of the man in whose kingdom a god took such a
special interest;<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> nor, again, was the gift of a divine
lover a thing that it was safe lightly to put aside.
All this, and much more of a kindred nature, must
have been present in the minds of those who first
saw this strange play, and must have served in
part to mitigate its strangeness. It could not, perhaps,
explain the central mystery; but then, the
mystery of self-sacrifice has never been explained
yet.</p>

<p>Another striking instance is the persistent way in
which Orestes and Pylades figure in the Athenian
drama. They play a prominent part in no fewer than
five tragedies, in one of which, the <i>Iphigeneia in
Tauris</i>, the scene between them became proverbial;<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
and thus we get repeated again and again the, to
modern minds, almost grotesque situation of the intense
affection between Orestes and Pylades, and the
intense affection between Orestes and Electra,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the supreme indifference between Pylades and
Electra, the two lovers who are going to marry one
another as soon as the curtain comes down. And
yet, those who have read what has gone before will
know that not only did this situation seem natural
to the Athenian audience, but any other situation
under the circumstances would have seemed to them
monstrous or absurd.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to follow this subject further,
for enough has been said already to make its main
features perfectly clear. Still less is it necessary, for
our present purpose, to study the history of this
emotion during the succeeding centuries. As we
have already pointed out, from the end of the fifth
century onwards it begins to lose its hold on the
popular imagination, and ceases to be a national
institution; and when next we find traces of it in
literature, we see at once that its nature has entirely
altered. Paederastic poetry there is enough and to
spare among the Alexandrians, but it is poetry which
looks strange indeed by the side of Theognis.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> What
were the causes that led to this change, a change as
great as that which about this time came over the
relation between man and woman—how far it was
due to Persian influence, how far to the employment
of professional soldiers instead of the citizen-armies
of an earlier period—all these are questions of the
greatest interest in themselves, but they cannot be
discussed here. The fact remains that that purity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
and self-devotion which had been the rule in one
generation became the exception in the next, and
that the downward course was never again fully
arrested throughout classical times.</p>

<p>And yet, even the most sensual of the later poets,
somehow, sometimes, when speaking of this, rise to
strange heights of beauty. Listen to Rhianus:</p>

of ground and dealt with a large variety of topics,
some of which may have appeared but remotely
connected with our immediate subject; but in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
end it has succeeded in establishing certain facts
very clearly. We have learnt from an examination
of such parts of the early Greek literature as have
survived, and from a consideration of the probable
nature of the rest, that</p>

<p>(1) Love in the modern sense, as existing between
men and women, was unknown in early Greece.</p>

<p>(2) Such love on the part of men for men was
not only a fact, but was generally recognised as a
social, and in some cases a national, institution.</p>

<p>From this it would seem inevitably to follow, that
the change which we find at a later period to have
come over the way of regarding women, was due
to a transference to the sexual instinct, and an
amalgamation with it, of that form of emotion which
had previously been confined to the mutual relations
of men. In other words, men first began to look
upon women as fit objects of pure and chivalrous
devotion, when they began (to quote the expression
of Alcman)<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> to look upon them as “female boy-friends.”</p>

<p>Now, my reason for calling attention to this point
is the following: If one regards the origin of what,
for briefness’ sake, we have called the romantic
feeling, as entirely a new growth of the fourth
century, unconnected with anything that had gone
before, it is obvious that such a growth, if indeed
possible at all, can only have been made possible
by a simultaneous movement on the part of a large
number of persons; for it is inconceivable that any
one man, however great his influence, could invent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
and popularise an entirely new emotion. But if,
on the other hand, we regard the romantic feeling
as simply due to the readjustment of an already
existing emotion, it is no longer absurd to suppose
that the original suggestion of this readjustment
may have been due to some single individual. Indeed,
the probabilities rather point in that direction,
for it is a commonplace that revolutions of thought
are generally due to the discovery, on the part of
some individual, of the apparently obvious formula
for which the rest of mankind have long been
seeking in vain. This being so, it will be justifiable
to apply the general principle to the case before
us, and it will no longer seem a fruitless task to
look about among the literary names of the close
of the fifth century and the beginning of the
fourth, for the man who gave the first impulse to
that remarkable movement with which we are at
present concerned.</p>

<p>The great obstacle which here confronts us at the
outset, and, indeed, makes this whole investigation
one of exceptional difficulty, is the fact that, of all
the periods of Greek poetry, that which covers the
first part of the fourth century—in other words, that
which forms the transition from the classical to the
so-called Alexandrian era—is just that of which the
fewest monuments of importance have been preserved.
From the death of Aristophanes to the
time when Asclepiades began to write is pretty
well 70 years,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> but all the poetry which has come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
down to us from this whole period consists of a
few fragments of comedy,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> most of which it is
impossible even approximately to date, and a few
epigrams, the history of which is often more obscure
still. There is thus a great gap in our knowledge,
and it is just during this interval of darkness that
the romantic feeling must first have found expression,
for while in Euripides, confessedly the most
“modern” of the classical poets, no real trace of
it is to be found,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> in Asclepiades and his immediate
contemporaries and followers we find it already so
thoroughly established as a noteworthy factor in
their work, that it is impossible to doubt that its
origin must belong to a considerably earlier period.
This being so, it is impossible to speak with any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
certainty. It seems, however, most probable that
the initiation of the movement was due to Antimachus
of Colophon.</p>

<p>Antimachus was a distinguished man in various
ways. The author of an important critical edition
of the text of the Homeric poems, he was himself
an epic poet second only in the general estimation
to Homer, and his <i>Thebaid</i> was still read and admired
more than 500 years after his death.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> But
the work on which his present claim rests is his
elegiac poem, <i>Lyde</i>. It may not be amiss briefly
to recall the circumstances and nature of this poem.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Antimachus, falling in love with some Lydian
lady, married her, and went to live with her in her
native country. Afterwards, on her death, he returned
to Colophon, where he composed, in her
memory, the elegy <i>Lyde</i>, a poem containing, in
the form of digressions, accounts of most of the
unhappy lovers of tradition or mythology.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Now, in this there are two features which it is
impossible to parallel in any previous Greek poem.
The <i>Lyde</i> of Antimachus was a love-poem addressed
to his wife, and written after her death.
In these two facts we recognise, on the part of
the writer, a view both of married life and of
women in general, which is entirely new. Mimnermus
had said that life without love was not
worth living, but his was hardly the love to last
after his lady’s death. Simonides had sung the
charms of the ideal housekeeper, but one would not
expect to find emotional poetry addressed even to
the most perfect housekeeper, as such. Euripides
had expatiated on the powers and the capabilities
of women; but there is a difference between regarding
a woman as a particularly cunning and
dangerous sort of beast, and regarding her as a
fit object for a life’s devotion. In Antimachus, for
the first time, we meet with the new spirit which
animates the new literature and forms the foundation
of the Greek romantic conception; for it is
respect for women and, above all, for marriage, that
constitutes the fundamental principle of the romantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
feeling throughout the later Greek poetry.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> It was
this spirit which rendered possible the artistic treatment
of the story of Acontius and Cydippe, and the
growth of the novel, with its one inviolable canon
that, whatever trials or temptations might befall
them, the two lovers must throughout remain pure
and faithful to one another.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> It was this that
rendered possible the New Comedy, with its endless
variations on the ever-fresh theme of the unhappy
lover, made happy at the last by marriage with his
lady.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> It was this that rendered possible the Battis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
of Philetas and the Leontium of Hermesianax, just
as it rendered possible the Delia and the Lycoris
of a later time. Under the old <i>régime</i> none of these
things could have been. When Antimachus first sat
down in his empty house at Colophon to write an
elegy to his dead wife, consciously or unconsciously,
he was initiating the greatest artistic revolution that
the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which the <i>Lyde</i> was
produced were thus in themselves sufficiently unusual
to have made a deep impression, and there is reason
to believe further that the way in which Antimachus
there treated his subject was also strikingly original.
Not only was the actual literary form a novel one,
and one that subsequently became very popular, but
the general tone evidently differed in a marked
manner from that of any love-poetry which had gone
before. It was, above all things, noticeable for its
seriousness, its gravity, and its self-restraint, characteristics
entirely foreign to any previous love-poetry
addressed to women. Thus Poseidippus expressly
contrasts the temperate Antimachus with the licentious
Mimnermus.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Something similar seems equally
implied by the epithet σεμνοτέρη in the epigram of
Asclepiades (<i>Anth. Pal.</i> ix. 63, 2). Indirect evidence
of the same nature is to be found in the remark of
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who refers to Antimachus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
as an instance τῆς αὐστηρᾶς ἁρμονίας.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Lastly, it is
not, perhaps, too far-fetched to suppose that in
Catullus xcv. the contrast between the <i>Smyrna</i> and
the <i>Lyde</i> is not intended to be confined merely to
the literary form, but is meant to further imply the
poet’s preference for the story of Myrrha over the less
highly spiced anecdotes in Antimachus. Very interesting
too, from this point of view, are the relations
of mutual admiration which are known to have
existed between Antimachus and his younger contemporary
Plato, an admiration illustrated by several
striking anecdotes.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> That the philosopher’s views on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
love were directly influenced by the poet cannot, of
course, be absolutely proved. At the same time, the
well-authenticated story of this intimacy, coupled
with all that we know of the <i>Lyde</i>, is very suggestive
of this, and might well furnish the subject for more
elaborate research on the part of some Platonist. In
spite therefore of the very scanty references to the
<i>Lyde</i>, and the still scantier remains of the poem itself,
it seems to be clear beyond doubt that, both in its
circumstances of origin and its style, it was entirely
different from any love-poem which had preceded it;
and, further, that both circumstances and style may
justly be described as romantic. In other words, the
<i>Lyde</i> was a romantic love-poem.</p>

<p>But this is not in itself enough to show that the
origin of the romantic feeling which appears in
Alexandrian literature was due to its influence. It
is further necessary to prove that those writers in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
whose works this feeling first appeals—viz.
Asclepiades and Philetas—were actually readers
and admirers of Antimachus.</p>

<p>This it is, perhaps, possible to do more conclusively
than the general absence of evidence on
the whole subject would have led one to expect. It
is just Asclepiades and his particular followers who
speak with the greatest enthusiasm of Antimachus.
Very noteworthy are the words of Asclepiades himself—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the passage in Poseidippus, where Antimachus
and Mimnermus, coupled but contrasted, are spoken
of as the first two love-poets, is scarcely less emphatic.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>In the case of Philetas, the evidence is also
strong. His elegies addressed to Battis are generally
admitted to have been modelled, in form, at any rate,
on the <i>Lyde</i> of Antimachus; and it does not seem
unjustifiable to infer from this that their spirit and
their general character were also, in the main, similar.
The way in which the two poets are coupled by Ovid
(<i>Trist.</i> i. 6, 1) seems to support this view, and, as we
have already seen, there is no evidence to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
To sum up, then: the conclusions arrived at
are briefly as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>(1) In extant Greek poetry there is no trace of
romantic love-poetry addressed to women, prior to
the time of Asclepiades and Philetas.</p>

<p>(2) In the works of these writers this element
suddenly appears, not in the nature of an experiment,
but as a leading motive—an almost sure proof
that they were not the originators of it.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>Lyde</i> of Antimachus was a work of such
a kind, both in nature and in circumstances of production,
that there is every reason to believe that
it was a romantic love-poem.</p>

<p>(4) Philetas and Asclepiades were notoriously
admirers of the <i>Lyde</i> of Antimachus.</p>

<p>(5) Therefore there is reason to believe that the
romantic element appearing in their poems was due
to the influence of Antimachus, who may thus be
regarded as the originator of the romantic element
in literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

</div>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Classification of Comedy</span></h3>

<p>The classification of Greek Comedy has been,
from the earliest times, a subject of dispute.
The ancient critics, for the most part, divided
comedy into two classes only—the Old Comedy,
which has a <i>parabasis</i>, and the New Comedy, which
has none. According to these critics, the acme of
the Old Comedy was reached during the Peloponnesian
War, that of the New Comedy during the
reign of Alexander. That this system of classification,
though sound as far as it goes, is not an
adequate one, will be admitted by every student of
the subject, and need not be further discussed. The
alternative division of comedy into three classes, corresponding
roughly to the sixth, seventh, and eighth
so-called periods of Greek literature<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>—a scheme of
arrangement that has on the whole been most
generally accepted in modern times—is also not a
very satisfactory one; for, apart from the initial
objection that it, like all similar chronological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
arrangements, is far too rigid to be applied to
anything so intangible as a literary tendency, there
is the further and graver objection that there is
really no essential difference whatever between the
comedies performed at Athens during the reign of
Philip and those performed there in the time of
Alexander.</p>

<p>The <i>Orge</i> of Menander, produced in the year after
the death of the latter monarch, might have been
produced, as far as one can judge of its character
by its remains, in any year of the previous fifty.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, it is certain that a
division of comedy into three classes rather than
two is necessary; for that the work of, say,
Apollodorus Carystius, differs as much from that
of Antiphanes as anything the latter ever wrote
does from the work of Eupolis, is a fact that no
one acquainted with the subject is likely to question.</p>

<p>The only satisfactory system of classification is
that based, not on style or chronology, but on
subject. Greek comedy falls naturally into three
great divisions—the Political, the Social, and the
Romantic,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and, to come at once to the point, these
three divisions are characterised by three distinct
ways of regarding women. The Political Comedy
practically ignores women altogether; the Social
Comedy admits the fascination of woman’s society as
an incident in a man’s life; the Romantic Comedy
claims woman’s love as the one topic of absorbing
interest for men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>And here it may at once be observed that the
relation between the first two forms of art is somewhat
different from that which exists between them
and the last. The Social Comedy was the natural
and logical development of the original primitive
comedy, and the Comedy of Cratinus, with its
political motive, was but a temporary branch of
the art, which, though growing at one time to such
striking proportions as well nigh to conceal the
parent stem, yet never actually prevented the
growth and development of the latter. The
Romantic Comedy, on the other hand, was the
result, not of development, but of revolution. It
was a deliberate attempt (undertaken in the first
instance, it would seem, by a single man of genius)
to inoculate the old Athenian drama with those
romantic ideas which were by this time beginning
to be freely expressed in various other parts of
Greece, and to combine the teaching of the epic
erotic legends, which were in essence ideal, with the
realism of Social Comedy.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>This being the case, one would not unnaturally
expect to find a more decided line of cleavage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
between the writers of the two last phases of Comedy
than is apparent in the previous case. And this is
unquestionably so. Throughout the fifth century we
find political and social comedy flourishing side by
side, the great mass of the comedians being equally
at home in either branch of the art, while, towards
the close of that century and at the beginning of
the next, the boundary line between the writers of
“Old” and “Middle” Comedy is notoriously a very
faint one. At the end of the fourth century, on the
other hand, the victory of the Romantic Comedy
was rapid and well-nigh complete, while there is
generally no difficulty in saying without hesitation
to which of the two classes, the modern or the old-fashioned,
any given play of the transition belonged.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>But while the most satisfactory classification of
Greek Comedy is unquestionably one on the lines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
suggested above, the ordinary division into Old,
Middle, and New Comedy, is so generally recognised
that it has seemed to me inadvisable to
ignore it altogether, and so these terms will be
found occurring repeatedly in the following pages.
To avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding,
however, it may be remarked that the term, “New
Comedy,” will always be used in the sense of
romantic comedy. The term, “Middle Comedy,”
will be used in its ordinary sense, except that it
will be extended to cover all works, irrespective of
author, which are akin to the school of Antiphanes
and Eubulus. The unsatisfactory term, “Old
Comedy,” will only be used in those passages where
the context renders its meaning unmistakable.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Origin of Comedy.</span></h3>

<p>Comedy was, in its origin, as seems indeed
necessary from its nature, social rather than
political. The scenes which the first comic actors
aimed at depicting appear, beyond doubt, to have
been representations of amusing incidents in the
everyday life of ordinary people, and were in no
way concerned with state policy; while the personalities
with which this form of entertainment
originally abounded, were aimed rather at rival
actors than at well-known public characters, and had
nothing at all in common with political lampoons.
It is true that Comedy generally received its chief
impulses at times of great popular license under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
democracies,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> but this fact really means no more
than that, at such periods, the amusements of the
people received greater attention than would be the
case under a tyranny or an oligarchy. No doubt
these extempore slanging-matches became, at an
early time already, very general in character, and
contained, among other promiscuous allusions, occasional
references, probably none too complimentary,
to important contemporary events or personages;
but that this was not their main feature, nor that
which supplied their chief interest, seems shown,
<i>inter alia</i>, by the fact that the first artistic development
they received at the hands of Epicharmus was
by no means in this direction. Nor, indeed, do the
earliest Attic comedies appear to have been political
in character, the few fragments of them which survive
seeming, in every case, to deal with social
subjects.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The first writer to make Comedy political—that
is, the first writer to give to the “Old” Comedy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Athens that which is, by modern readers, generally
regarded as its most essential characteristic—was
Cratinus. He, abandoning in great part that endeavour
to amuse which had been the primary object
of his predecessors, deliberately made use of Comedy
as a political party engine, or, as he would perhaps
have preferred to call it, as a means of attacking
those who did harm to the state.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The success of
the new element thus imported seems to have been
very great; but, at the same time, it must not be
supposed that the work of Cratinus was all of this
nature. In the first place, some of his plays were
of a distinctly general character. Thus the <i>Odysses</i>
was a simple parody of the <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer, and,
as such, was the distinct forerunner of a class of
piece very common in the Social Comedy of the
fourth century.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The <i>Cleobulinae</i>, with its enigmas,
is equally suggestive of another feature of the same
period of art. In like manner, the <i>Panoptae</i>, with
its attacks on the philosopher Hippo, the <i>Seriphii</i>,
with its mythological allusions, and the <i>Horae</i>, with
its apparent discussions of tragedy, all point to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
direction in which lay the true development of the
art of Comedy.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>But, popular as the indiscriminate mud-throwing
of Cratinus undoubtedly was with a large section of
that cultured Athenian audience which one is taught
to admire, a certain reaction was, in course of time,
almost inevitable; and such a reaction was actually
furnished by the comedies of Crates. Crates is
described as the first Attic comedian to develop
Comedy on the lines of Epicharmus, and to introduce
a plot with apparently fictitious or allegorical
characters, instead of merely bringing public characters
on the stage and making them ridiculous.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>From a very early period, therefore, Comedy at
Athens falls into two classes, the personal, which is
usually also political, and the general or social, though
the line of demarcation is not, of course, a very rigid
one, since writers of the latter class would seldom
feel much hesitation in attacking anyone who had
made himself particularly obnoxious to them, even
if he were a political character, while those of the
former were also frequently compelled, for equally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
personal reasons, to set a limit to their righteous
indignation. Thus Pherecrates, the most important
of the actual imitators of Crates,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> is by no means
averse to an occasional personality, while a writer of
the very opposite school, Hermippus, was yet the
author of the <i>Athenas Gonae</i>.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Plato and Aristophanes
are, of course, equally striking instances of the same
fact occurring at a later date.</p>

<p>From the preceding paragraphs, which might have
been considerably extended, had it not lain somewhat
outside the present subject to extend them, one
fact at least will be abundantly clear. That system of
treating subjects rather than persons as material for
comedy which is sometimes spoken of as a distinctive
feature of “Middle” Comedy (using that term in
its chronological sense), had already been in vogue
at Athens from the very earliest times; in fact, what
are commonly called “Old” and “Middle” Comedy
are, in spirit, intimately associated with one another,
and the most important differences between them
are in purely external matters, brought about by
external causes.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>This fact will not be without its importance in
considering our immediate subject. In the first
place, it will cause us to find in the early Athenian
comedy two distinct ways of regarding women,
which, while contemporaneous, have very little else in
common with one another. The comedy of the
school of Cratinus,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> being concerned with public
characters and with them alone, naturally ignores
women almost entirely.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The comedy of the school
of Crates, on the other hand, is very similar in its
treatment of women to the comedy of the beginning
of the fourth century, except that, in so far as the
position of women in Athenian society was a less
important one in the middle of the fifth century than
it was some seventy years later, the female element
is not such a pronounced feature of these early works
as it is of the later.</p>

<p>A detailed examination of the treatment of women
in early comedy, as far as such is possible by means
of the fragments, will serve to illustrate the foregoing
somewhat general remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Early Comedy.</span></h3>

<p>Cratinus, in that work at any rate which is truly
characteristic of his genius, is entirely engrossed in
public affairs, and in attacking the characters of
public men. It is not, therefore, surprising to find
that in his plays women are almost entirely ignored.
The one notable exception is Aspasia, who is, it is
true, alluded to more than once, and that in no very
complimentary terms; but this is, of course, only
what one would expect of an opponent of Pericles.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
The poet’s views of married life are sufficiently
illustrated by his <i>Pytine</i>. It is, however, to be
observed that, in those of his plays which, from
legislative causes, approximated more closely to the
contemporary social comedy, the female element is
more apparent, though even here it is never really
prominent. Thus the <i>Cleobulinae</i> appears to have
introduced a chorus of women propounding enigmas,
while both the <i>Nemesis</i> and the <i>Seriphii</i> contained at
least allusions to erotic mythological incidents.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The other early poets of the political school are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
still more barren of references to women; indeed
the fragments of Teleclides, Hermippus, and Eupolis,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
put together, do not furnish a single noticeable
instance.</p>

<p>It is otherwise, as already remarked, with the
school of Crates. The fragments of Crates himself
do not indeed furnish much of interest in this connection,
except, perhaps, the rather <i>risqué</i> remarks in
<i>Fr. Incert.</i> 3 and 4, but from Pherecrates there is
more to be learnt. In the first place, three of his
plays, the <i>Corianno</i>, <i>Thalatta</i>, and <i>Petale</i>, are named
after Hetaerae, a common enough feature in later
times, but rare at this early period; while the first
two of these, at any rate, were evidently devoted
to a study of the life of this class of person. Thus
the <i>Corianno</i> describes (<i>Fr.</i> 1, 2, 3, 4) the drinking
propensities of its heroine;<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> while the <i>Thalatta</i> gives
one even further particulars, <i>Fr.</i> 7 describing the
arrival at Thalatta’s house of her lover<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> (perhaps the
Epilesmon, the “Absent-minded Man,” from whom
the piece had its second title), and <i>Fr.</i> 2, 3, and 5
their supper together, while <i>Fr.</i> 4 shows clearly that
a lover’s quarrel of some sort duly found its place in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the piece.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Of the <i>Petale</i> no important fragment
remains. Whether the <i>Pannychis</i> dealt with one of
those incidents which are so common in New
Comedy, it is impossible to say.</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Aristophanes.</span></h3>

<p>The remains of Pherecrates, therefore, notwithstanding
their very meagre character, supply ample
evidence that, at this period already, some of the
most popular characters and scenes of early fourth-century
comedy had found a place on the Athenian
stage<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>; but a still more interesting field of study is
furnished by those poets who belong to the period
of transition which commences with the decline of
the Athenian power, and more especially by those
who began life as adherents of the personal and
political school of Cratinus, and were afterwards
compelled, by force of circumstances, to identify
themselves with a different style of art. Foremost
among these is, of course, the name of Aristophanes.
The earlier plays of Aristophanes contain few
allusions to women, and throughout his works it
may be doubted whether he ever introduced a female
character on the stage except with the ultimate
intention of leading up to some form of indecency.
At the same time, since the fact that his plays
have been preserved affords a better opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of judging of his views than is to be had in the
case of any other writer of the period, it will
perhaps be well to examine some of his characteristics
in greater detail.</p>

<p>The first and, perhaps, the most striking feature
in the Aristophanic treatment of women—a feature
which is very prominent indeed in certain plays—is
the respect which the poet professes to feel for
women’s judgment and powers of organisation.
Thus, in the <i>Lysistrata</i>, the treaty between Athens
and Sparta, which is admitted on all sides to be
desirable, can only be brought about through the
intervention of a woman. Similarly, in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>,
when the government of the city has fallen
into a deplorable state, it is reorganised by the
women, and their scheme of reorganisation is, we
are given to understand, a complete success, for the
time being at any rate. Again, in the lost play of
the <i>Scenas Catalambanusae</i>, there seems little doubt
that the motive of the action was an appeal on the
part of the poet from the male audience who had
not appreciated him, to a female audience which he
expected to find endowed with better taste.</p>

<p>All this is very pleasing as far as it goes. The
question is:—How far is this respect professed for
women, genuine? Enquiry would seem to show that
very little of it, if any, is genuine at all. Of the
<i>Scenas Catalambanusae</i> it is impossible to speak with
certainty,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> but, as for the other two plays mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
above, it is hard to believe that the women are introduced
for any other purpose than that of leading up
to the various scenes of indecency which afford the
main interest of both pieces. The climax of the
<i>Lysistrata</i> is the pathetic speech of Cinesias (865
<i>seqq.</i>), that of the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> the struggle between
the γραῦς and the νεανίς (877 <i>seqq.</i>), and neither of
these scenes can be said to show much respect for
female nature. As for the success of the women’s
efforts in both these plays, it is perhaps sufficient to
observe that in each case the poet’s main object was
to point out the advantages of a particular course
of action, not to suggest any novel method of
procedure by means of which this course was to be
adopted. The political object of both comedies is
merely to attack the government of the day. No
one who has ever read these plays would be likely
to argue that they advocated the extension of the
franchise to women, or indeed concerned themselves
in any way with any subject of the kind.
To put it shortly, the women are introduced for
indecency’s sake, and their revolutions succeed
simply because they are revolutions against the
existing order of things, an order of which
Aristophanes did not approve. It would be as
reasonable to suppose that the <i>Aves</i> was a serious
piece of advice to the Athenians to consult with
birds about the management of the State, as to
assume that the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> meant to imply that
the views of women were really worthy of consideration
or adoption.</p>

<p>The incessant allusions in these plays, no less than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
in others, to the incontinence,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> the drunkenness, and
the various other faults with which it was usual at
the time to tax women—allusions which frequently
take the form of frank confessions on the part of the
women themselves—are so numerous that there is no
need to quote any of them.</p>

<p>Another rather striking feature is the way in
which several of the plays of Aristophanes conclude
with the wedding of one of the characters—a feature
at first sight very suggestive of the comedy typical
of a much later period. The best known instance of
this is perhaps in the <i>Eirene</i>, but the same seems to
have been the case in the <i>Polyidus</i> (where the successful
soothsayer is rewarded with the hand of the
king’s daughter, Phaedra), and in the <i>Geras</i>, where
the hero, having been miraculously restored to youth,
repudiates his former wife, and marries one more
suited to his recently acquired—or lost—years. It
must, however, be observed that in none of these
plays, as far as one can see, is the wedding of the
hero by any means the logical result of the action
of the piece; it is merely an incidental episode
introduced, in the <i>Eirene</i> at any rate, and very
possibly also in the others, simply with the view of
providing the chorus with an effective exit. In the
<i>Polyidus</i>, moreover, it is clear that though Minos
gives his daughter as a reward, he has his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
opinion as to the value of the gift, an opinion which
is hardly complimentary to Phaedra<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>; while in the
<i>Geras</i> there can be little reasonable doubt that the
connubial arrangements were made the occasion for
a plentiful supply of obscenities, <i>quae nunc desiderantur</i>,
if one can use the words in such a connection.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
One must be careful, therefore, not to exaggerate
the importance of this feature in the Aristophanic
treatment of women, though it cannot, of course, be
denied that to introduce a wedding at all on the
stage was a distinct advance on strict Athenian
views with reference to such events.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Aristophanes was above all things, by profession at
least, a conservative and a <i>laudator temporis acti</i>;
but, strangely enough, this characteristic of his is but
little noticeable in his treatment of women. Nothing
would have been more natural, one would have
thought, than that he should, in the course of some of
his highly-coloured pictures of primeval felicity before
the days of Euripides and the philosophers, have
dwelt upon the purity of ancient family life and
the chastity of a previous generation of women, in
contrast to that present depravity to which he makes
such frequent allusion. But, true to his Athenian
temperament, he never follows any such line, nor
indeed does he ever take up high ground on this
subject. Ready as he is to moralise seriously on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
other matters, even on matters so distinctly erotic
as the relations of man to man,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> his tone with regard
to women is invariably flippant.</p>

<p>Women are, above all things, conservative:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(<i>Eccles.</i> 225.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Euripides may have made rude remarks about
women, but his suggestions are politeness itself compared
with what might have been said.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Indeed, the
main charge of the women against Euripides in the
<i>Thesmophoriazusae</i> is not that he has maligned them,
but that he has opened the eyes of their husbands
to what they actually do.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It is needless to multiply
instances; the general tendency is plain. Woman in
Aristophanes is invariably an object of ridicule. So
incapable was he of treating her otherwise, that his
one ideal woman, Eirene, for whom the knight-errant
Trygaeus flies up to heaven on the dung-beetle, was
a colossal failure, a κολοσσικὸν ἄγαλμα that was the
general laughing-stock of his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>This being so, there is but little need to dwell on
such “erotic” passages as do occur, here and there
in his works, between men and women. Such scenes,
of which the best instance is perhaps that in the
<i>Ecclesiazusae</i> (877 <i>seqq.</i>), are never the main motive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
of the plot; they are merely more or less irrelevant
incidents, developed or not according to the chances
they afford for the introduction of amusing indecencies.
In these scenes Aristophanes is often to be
seen at his very best, but they cannot of course be
drawn upon with the object of supplying evidence
as to his real views of women, except in so far as
they serve still further to emphasise what has already
been said as to the poet’s disinclination to deal
seriously with the subject of women at all. Indeed,
his view of the proper relation between love and
art is sufficiently illustrated by the famous argument
in the <i>Ranae</i> (1043 <i>seqq.</i>) between Aeschylus and
Euripides, where, after the former has stated with
pride:</p>

<p class="noindent">and the latter has defended his own erotic treatment

</div>
</div>

<p>The treatment of erotic subjects in a realistic
manner is not the business of a true poet!</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">The Cocalus.</span></h3>

<p>With this before one, it would seem hardly necessary
to say anything further about the erotic element
in Aristophanes. There is, however, one play of his—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
last, or last but one, that he wrote—which
seems at first sight to differ so entirely in spirit
from the rest, that it is well worthy of separate
notice.</p>

<p>This play is the <i>Cocalus</i>, a work of which it is
distinctly stated by ancient authorities that it anticipated
one of the most characteristic features of
romantic comedy—nay more, that it actually served
as the model for Menander and Philemon. Thus,
in the <i>Vita Aristophanis</i>, p. xxxviii., it is said: ἐγένετο
δὲ καὶ αἴτιος ζήλου τοῖς νέοις κωμικοῖς, λέγω δὴ Φιλήμονι
καὶ Μενάνδρῳ ... ἔγραψε Κώκαλον, ἐν ᾧ εἰσάγει
φθορὰν καὶ ἀναγνωρισμὸν καὶ τἄλλα πάντα ἃ ἐζήλωσε
Μένανδρος, and again, p. xxxv.: πρῶτος δὲ καὶ τῆς νέας
κωμῳδίας τὸν τρόπον ἐπέδειξεν ἐν τῷ Κωκάλῳ, ἐξ οὗ
τὴν ἀρχὴν λαβόμενοι Μένανδρός τε καὶ Φιλήμων ἐδραματούργησαν.</p>

<p>Of these statements, the one part, startling as it
is, must presumably be accepted without question.
In the face of such definite evidence, it would be
rash to attempt to deny that one of the features of
Aristophanes’ play was φθορὰ καὶ ἀναγνωρισμός—a
feature which is, as is well known, not only one of
the commonest in romantic comedy, but also peculiarly
characteristic of the love-element as there
treated. The sort of story of which we are speaking
is sufficiently familiar to every reader of Terence.
A man seduces a girl, either without knowing at
all who she is, or else under the impression that
she is a foreigner or a slave. Afterwards she is
proved to be an Athenian citizen, and he, being
still in love, marries her, with the double object of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
atoning for his fault and of continuing his amour
on a legitimate basis.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>But here a question arises. Granted that Aristophanes
anticipated one of the most characteristic
situations of the romantic comedy, in how far, if
at all, did he anticipate the romantic treatment of
that situation, such as we subsequently find it?
Aristophanes, as we have seen, has the first part
of the romantic love-story in his <i>Cocalus</i>; is it
probable that he also had the second? He has
the seduction and the recognition; is it probable
that he had also the <i>amende honorable</i> prompted by
feelings of respect and devotion? And, as a natural
pendant to this, is it probable that the <i>Cocalus</i> was
really, as asserted, the model after which the later
romantic comedy was formed?</p>

<p>It is not probable. No one who knows the works
of Aristophanes, and considers the character of the
Athenians of his day, would expect such a thing;
and, apart from this inherent improbability, there
are various reasons which seem to suggest that the
second part of the anonymous grammarian’s statement
was based upon a misconception. But, before
discussing any of these points, it will be necessary
to investigate, as far as possible, the exact nature
of this play of Aristophanes, for which so much is
claimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>An examination of the actual remains of the
<i>Cocalus</i> will not afford very much information, for
the fragments preserved are few and unimportant,
while the mercurial nature of Aristophanes’ plots,
as we know them from existing plays, makes it
obviously hazardous to venture conjectures as to
what they may or may not have included. Certain
facts, however, seem sufficiently clear. For one
thing, the play was based, at any rate originally
and ostensibly, on the legendary history of Cocalus,
Daedalus, and Minos. This history was, briefly, as
follows:—</p>

<p>Daedalus, after his flight from Crete, took refuge
with Cocalus, king of Sicily, and rose to high favour
at his court. When Minos, having learnt his whereabouts,
demanded his surrender, Cocalus at first
seemed willing to comply, and invited Minos to
his palace. The latter, suspecting nothing, accepted
the invitation, and was at once murdered in his
bath, either by Cocalus himself or by his daughters.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>That the latter version of the final incident was
accepted by Aristophanes seems probable, but even
so it is hard to see how the φθορὰ καὶ ἀναγνωρισμός
can be brought into the story. It is, perhaps, justifiable
to assume that the hero of the amour was
Daedalus, and that the lady was subsequently recognised
as a daughter of Cocalus; but how this all
came about, it is well-nigh impossible to say. In
some of the fragments we are apparently introduced
to a regular Hetaera (<i>e.g.</i> 2, 10; and, perhaps, 6, 7);
in another, however (<i>Fr.</i> 3), a woman seems vigorously
repudiating some slur cast on her character. It
cannot, of course, be proved that the plot<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
one of the regular New Comedy kind: The daughter
of Cocalus, being stolen as a child, became the
property of a <i>leno</i>, and was thus brought in contact
with Daedalus, &amp;c. But it seems to me much more
probable that the structure of the story was somewhat
of the following kind. The daughter of Cocalus
is violated by Daedalus on the occasion of a nocturnal
orgy, without being recognised by her lover. She,
however, is aware of his identity, and consequently,
when the time comes, murders Minos, an event which
necessitates explanations (the ἀναγνωρισμός of the
grammarian).<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> One thing there is to be said in
favour of this scheme of reconstruction, though, of
course, when the evidence is so slight, it is impossible
to feel anything like confidence with regard to this or
any other suggestion. If this view be adopted,
Aristophanes may be assumed to have chosen his
story with the object of satirising the <i>Pannychides</i>
and other similar orgies, which were always a
favourite subject of attack with him, and which he
had already abused in the <i>Horae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> the <i>Lemniae</i>, and,
perhaps, elsewhere.</p>

<p>But, be this as it may, one thing is plain. There
is nothing, either in the story of the <i>Cocalus</i> or in
its treatment, as far as the fragments allow one to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
judge of this, which has any real sympathy with
that later feeling which inspires the romantic
comedy. For one thing, the erotic incident, such
as it is, belongs entirely to that primitive class in
which the action is all on the side of the woman.
The daughter of Cocalus saving her lover is but
a reflection of Medea or Ariadne. In the later
romantic comedy, on the other hand, the action is
regularly on the side of the man; for, as is well
known, the attempts of the lover to outwit his
father or the <i>leno</i> supply pretty well the whole
stock of the incidents of New Comedy. Again,
there is no suggestion whatever, as far as one can
judge, of any marriage by way of reparation, or,
indeed, of any marriage at all;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and marriage, as
we shall see very clearly later on, is the fundamental
principle of Greek romance. Again, there is no
suggestion—and this is still more important—that
the love of Daedalus was described as more than
a mere temporary emotion; and here is another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
point of difference between this play and the
romantic New Comedy. In fact, if one comes to
examine the story of the <i>Cocalus</i> carefully, it
becomes apparent that the essential features of
Greek romance are entirely wanting. Indeed, the
only real affinity of this play to the New Comedy
seems to be that it anticipated, or possibly suggested,
some of the rather cumbrous conventional machinery
of the latter form of art.</p>

<p>A further fact, which well-nigh precludes the possibility
of regarding the <i>Cocalus</i> as the real model of
New Comedy, is furnished by the dates. The date
of the <i>Cocalus</i> cannot be fixed later than the year
380 or thereabouts. The first play of Philemon,
admittedly the most ancient poet who wrote romantic
comedies, appeared in 330. Thus, even if it were
granted that such romantic comedies were among
the earliest of Philemon’s works, which was almost
certainly not the case,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> there would still be an
interval of at least fifty years during which the
“romantic” <i>Cocalus</i> of Aristophanes did not find
a single imitator. The works of Antiphanes,
Eubulus, and, indeed, all the typical writers of
“Middle” Comedy, do not contain so much as a
suggestion of a romantic element, and yet, before
the time of all of them, there was in existence a
perfect romantic comedy, which only needed to be
revived by Philemon to bring about a complete
revolution of the canons of dramatic art. In fact,
the introduction of the romantic element into
comedy—that is, the birth of the modern drama—was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
due to a chance resuscitation by Philemon
of an obscure piece that had been lying unnoticed
for more than fifty years. <i>Credat Apella.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, if one comes to consider the matter,
there were powerful causes at work in the minds
of the early critics, which may very well have led
them to assign an undue degree of importance to
the <i>Cocalus</i>. Such causes would be mainly of two
distinct kinds.</p>

<p>In the first place, there was the tendency, with
which every student of ancient and mediaeval
criticism is familiar, to exaggerate the merits of
certain individuals, and to ascribe to certain admittedly
great names an even more extended
influence than they actually possessed.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It seemed
only natural, therefore, to the ancient critic to
expect that Aristophanes, being admittedly the
greatest of the comedians, should not only have
profoundly influenced his own immediate field of
art, but should also have laid the foundations of
every subsequent form of comedy. The grammarian,
therefore, who found in the story of the <i>Cocalus</i>
a certain resemblance to stories with which he was
familiar in the plays of the New Comedy, felt no
hesitation in affirming that the <i>Cocalus</i> was actually
the model on which these plays of the New Comedy
were based, just as Platonius (p. xxxiv.) speaks of
the <i>Aeolosicon</i> as ὁ τῆς μέσης κωμῳδίας τύπος.</p>

<p>In the second place, the story of the <i>Cocalus</i> had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
actually been converted into a “New” Comedy play—the
<i>Hypobolimaeus</i> of Philemon<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>—and the existence
of this neo-comic version of the story may very possibly
have influenced the recollections of the original;
for it is more than probable that the play of Philemon,
while adopting the main features of the story as it
appeared in Aristophanes, yet differed considerably
in its general treatment of the erotic incidents. In
other words, there is little reason to doubt that
Philemon, actuated by the changed spirit of his
time, developed the romantic capabilities of the
story to the utmost, and gave a romantic interpretation
to various situations, where nothing of the
kind had been done or intended by Aristophanes.
And hence the fact that a romantic version of the
<i>Cocalus</i> was familiar, served to spread the idea that
the original <i>Cocalus</i> was romantic also, and, as
such, a forerunner of the romantic element in New
Comedy, whereas, as a matter of fact, it was nothing
of the kind, owing its romantic colouring entirely
to the influence of the ideas disseminated by that
New Comedy which it was erroneously supposed
to inspire.</p>

<p>To sum up, then: There seems little reason to
believe that the <i>Cocalus</i> is really as important for
the history of the romantic element as would at
first sight appear. Apart from the strong <i>prima
facie</i> improbability of finding a romantic love-story
in a play by Aristophanes, there is the further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
remarkable fact that the Aristophanic suggestion,
if really given, found no one to take it up for more
than fifty years. Again, while the legendary history
of Cocalus and the fragments of the play, as far
as such have been preserved, do not actually preclude
the possibility that the erotic incident may have
been treated in a romantic manner, they certainly
furnish no evidence whatever in favour of such a
view. There are, besides, various reasons which
may have induced the ancient critics to see a
greater resemblance between the <i>Cocalus</i> and the
plays of the New Comedy than was actually present.
On the whole, therefore, it would appear that the
similarity between this work of Aristophanes and
the romantic comedies of Menander and his followers,
is merely an accidental and superficial one,
and that it is incorrect to say, as some have done,
that the latter class of composition was derived
from or inspired by the former.</p>

<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">The Poets of the Transition.</span></h3>

<p>To return after this somewhat lengthy digression
to our examination of the poets of the transition.</p>

<p>Plato, even more than his model Aristophanes, was
a follower of the political school of Cratinus, revelling
in personal attacks of the most violent kind, and
hence there seems little reason to doubt that such
of his plays as bear the stamp of Middle Comedy
belong to his later period, and were only produced,
decidedly <i>invita Minerva</i>, when the free license of
abuse had been artificially checked. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
allusions in his works to women or erotic subjects
seem to have been unusually scarce. In the <i>Adonis</i>,
mention is made of the rival lovers of the hero,
Aphrodite and Dionysus; but there is nothing to
indicate that this play contained anything of the
nature of a serious exposition of the respective
claims of male and female love. The <i>Zeus
Cacumenus</i> very probably introduced Zeus in his
usual comic character of the adulterer, as did the
<i>Nyx Macra</i>,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and the <i>Europe</i> may very possibly have
treated of a similar subject. More original, however,
and interesting than these is the <i>Phaon</i>, which seems
to have been one of the poet’s latest works, and
which furnishes a good specimen of his manner of
treating women. Phaon, having been presented by
Aphrodite with the cosmetics which were to inspire
universal passion, appears surrounded by a crowd of
admiring women, who are, however, refused access to
his presence, unless they perform certain propitiatory
rites (<i>Fr.</i> 2), and otherwise prove themselves worthy
of the honour. The means by which one lady eventually
qualifies (<i>Fr.</i> 4) can only be guessed, but the
language of <i>Fr.</i> 3 seems to suggest that the contest
was somewhat after the manner of those described in
<i>Anth. Pal.</i> v. 35 or Alciphron i. 39, 4 <i>seqq.</i><a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
interest of this piece lies in the fact that the plot is,
despite its ribald handling, unequivocally a love-story,
and, as such, perhaps distinct from any piece that we
have hitherto had occasion to examine. That the
love-story is, however, of the kind which belongs
essentially to Middle Comedy, and has nothing whatever
in common with those of the later romantic
comedy, will become abundantly clear when we come
to deal with the points of difference between these
two schools of art.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The information to be gained from the remains of
the other poets of the transitional period is sadly
scanty. The <i>Moechi</i> of Ameipsias, a play which, to
judge by the title, might have thrown much light on
the present subject, is hopelessly lost. Of the <i>Sappho</i>
even the title is doubtful. The celebrated <i>Ichthys</i> of
Archippus seems to have contained punning allusions
to the Hetaerae Sepia and Aphye, a sign of the
growing inclination to discuss this class of persons
on the stage. The latter lady, or a namesake of hers,
is mentioned by Callias in his <i>Cyclopes</i>. Of the
<i>Atalanta</i> of the same writer, one line is preserved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">κέρδος αἰσχύνης ἄμεινον· ἕλκε μοιχὸν ἐς μυχόν,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which seems in some sort to suggest that episode
in the life of the mythical Atalanta, daughter of
Schoeneus, which led to her metamorphosis<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>; but,
seeing that even the title <i>Atalanta</i> is doubtful, this
conjecture cannot be considered as very certain.
Strattis appears to have introduced Lais on the stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
in his <i>Macedones</i> (<i>Fr.</i> 5), and in his parodies of the
<i>Medea</i>, the <i>Phoenissae</i>, &amp;c., the female characters of
Euripides doubtless came in for their full share of
ridicule, though no definite evidence to this effect has
been preserved.</p>

<p>A little more information is to be gained from the
works of those poets who belonged to the very end
of the period of transition. Thus, the plays of
Theopompus, which deal almost exclusively with
Middle Comedy subjects, furnish several instances of
that treatment of female characters with which one
is familiar in the plays of the Middle Comedy proper.
The <i>Aphrodisia</i> introduces us to the Hetaerae celebrating
their customary festival. <i>Fr.</i> 1 affords a
specimen of the remarks passed on absent friends
on such occasions,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> while <i>Fr.</i> 2 gives further details of
the festivities. The solitary but considerable fragment
of the <i>Nemea</i> (called after the Hetaera of that name)
gives a lively description of a scene in which an
intending lover is doing his best to gain the approval
of the lady’s <i>lena</i>, a class which was, doubtless, as
devoted then to the <i>curto vetus amphora collo</i> as it was
400 years later.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> In the <i>Capelides</i> it is equally
possible to get a glimpse of the action of the piece.
A man dropping in at the bar of a house he has been
in the habit of frequenting, and finding himself less
effusively welcomed than he had had reason to hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
(<i>Fr.</i> 3, 4), threatens to attack the proprietress and the
rival of whom he is jealous (<i>Fr.</i> 5). Of the rest, the
<i>Hedychares</i> described a wedding ceremony (<i>Fr.</i> 3),<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
the <i>Callaeschrus</i> contained an allusion to the expensiveness
of certain Hetaerae, and general erotic allusions
are not uncommon (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Odysseus</i> 1, <i>Medus</i> 2). The
<i>Stratiotides</i> seems to have had some points in common
with the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> of Aristophanes. Alcaeus,
who is one of the very latest in date of the writers
usually ranked as belonging to the “Old” Comedy,
deals in nearly all his plays with erotic subjects,
mostly in the shape of mythological stories burlesqued.
To this class belong the <i>Pasiphae</i>, the
<i>Hierus Gamus</i>, the <i>Endymion</i>, the <i>Ganymedes</i>, and
perhaps the <i>Callisto</i>, unless this be, like the <i>Palaestra</i>,
named after an Hetaera. From this list of titles it
may be seen that every style of love came in for
treatment, but in no case are the fragments sufficiently
numerous, for it to be possible even to hazard
a guess as to what the nature of that treatment may
have been. As to the plot of the <i>Adelphae Moecheuomenae</i>,
we are equally in the dark, though the title
seems to suggest the <i>Aeolosicon</i> of Aristophanes and
the <i>Canace</i> of Euripides. Lastly, in the <i>Antea</i> of
Eunicus and the <i>Thalatta</i> of Diodes, both named<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
after Hetaerae, we have two further instances of a
class of piece with which we have been steadily
growing more familiar, the nearer we have approached
the confines of the typical “Middle” Comedy.</p>

<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">The Middle Comedy.</span></h3>

<p>The poets of the transition, of whom we have just
been speaking, have introduced us, more or less, to
most, if not all, of the features which belong to the
Middle Comedy proper; at the same time, it may
not be amiss, for clearness’ sake, to recapitulate
briefly those features, in so far as they affect our
immediate subject.</p>

<p>The points on which it is essential to concentrate
the attention are three in number:—</p>

<p>(1) In Middle Comedy, the preponderance of
politics as the main dramatic interest—a preponderance
which, naturally, tended to exclude women
from the stage—disappears, and, consequently, female
characters step inevitably into a more prominent
position.</p>

<p>(2) The restriction of the original license of
Comedy, had led the comedians to devote their
talents to parodying mythological subjects; the
parodists of mythology would naturally find their
readiest materials in the stories of the amours of
the various gods, and hence erotic stories of a sort
at once come to the fore.</p>

<p>(3) Middle Comedy being in great part, if not
entirely, devoted to the realistic treatment of contemporary
social life, the Hetaerae, who formed an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
important feature in that life, were necessarily
brought into prominence.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Of these three main features,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> the first two will not
require special illustration,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> but the last is one on
which it will be necessary to dwell for some time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>The Hetaera-plays<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> are one of the most characteristic
features of the fourth century; indeed, it may
almost be said that admiration for the Hetaera, and
ridicule of the wife, were the two main social canons
of the period. These plays seem to have been
realistic representations of contemporary life, and
their general character is sufficiently demonstrated
by the well-known retort of Antiphanes to Alexander;<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
but while they all thus have, as it were, a
certain family likeness, it would appear, beyond
doubt, that they may be also divided into two
distinct classes, viz., those that have a distinct erotic
plot, and those that have none, the latter naturally
belonging to an earlier period of development than
the former.</p>

<p>Plays dealing with Hetaerae were not, as we have
already seen, exclusively a feature of the fourth-century
Comedy, though the majority of such plays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
does, of course, belong to this period. In the very
beginnings of Comedy at Athens, we have at least
three plays of this class from the pen of Pherecrates,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
while, at a later period of the fifth century, other
works of a similar character seem certainly to have
appeared.</p>

<p>The general character of these plays, however,
seems, in spite of the modernity of their subject, to
have been essentially that prevailing during the early
period to which they belong. Pherecrates and his
imitators seem to have been merely concerned in
drawing a picture—perhaps a somewhat burlesque
one—of the general life of an Hetaera and her
followers, and in dwelling upon the various comic
incidents which might occur in her environment,
without troubling to connect these incidents by
means of any very definite story. In other words,
the Hetaera-play of Pherecrates was still, in the
main, that mixture of pantomime and variety-show
with which one is familiar in Aristophanes, and with
which one’s ideas of the early Athenian Comedy are
usually associated. And that plays of this class continued
to be produced with success till well into
the fourth century, there seems no reason to doubt.</p>

<p>The typical Hetaera-play of the Middle Comedy,
however, is of an entirely different character. In this
there is a definite plot, of which the Hetaera is the
heroine, while the action of the piece is supplied by
the struggles <i>de nocte locanda</i> of her various rival
lovers. In fact, the Hetaera-play of Antiphanes or
Alexis is a comedy in the modern sense of the word,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
while the Hetaera-play of an earlier period is still
nothing but an extravaganza. The author of this
great change is not known; perhaps it was Anaxandrides.</p>

<p>It is stated of Anaxandrides that he was the first
to introduce ἔρωτας καὶ παρθένων φθοράς<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> into
Comedy. This statement is, at first sight, rather
difficult to understand, when one considers plays like
the <i>Nemesis</i> of Cratinus, or the <i>Cocalus</i> of Aristophanes,
not to speak of erotic episodes like the one
which terminates the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> of the latter
writer; and it must be apparent that the mere introduction
on the stage of such subjects cannot be the
merit claimed by Suidas for Anaxandrides. The
most simple explanation of the apparent anomaly
would therefore seem to be, that what Suidas means
to imply, is that Anaxandrides was the first to make
erotic subjects the main interest of his plot, and to
introduce his principal characters as taking part in
them; for this, as we have already seen, was not the
case with the earlier plays which dealt with erotic
matters.</p>

<p>Whether this great advance was really due to
Anaxandrides cannot, unfortunately, be proved with
anything like certainty, for such fragments of his
works as have survived are remarkably reticent on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
this particular subject;<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> but there can be no doubt
that it took place about his time, so that there is at
least a strong probability, under the circumstances,
that it was the result of his influence.</p>

<p>On the first and older class of Hetaera-play, it is
useless to dwell further; a certain vague idea of
their general nature is all that can be gained by the
study of their fragments, and the external evidence
as to their character is equally meagre, while the
intentional want of coherence which marked their
action makes it obviously absurd to endeavour in
any way to reconstruct them. The character of the
second and, for our purposes, more important class,
will be best explained by a brief examination of one
or two striking specimens, the remains of which are
sufficiently important to render it possible to follow
their story, at any rate for a certain distance.</p>

<p>Thus, in the <i>Campylion</i> of Eubulus, we are introduced
to two men, one of whom sighs with quite
modern plaintiveness over the heavy burden of his
love for a certain κοσμία ἑταίρα:</p>

<p>Through the agency of the friend, who is evidently
more of a man of the world, the lovers meet at a
supper party, which was probably at least a <i>partie
carrée</i>. Here the friend gives vent to various cynical
remarks on women:—</p>

<p class="noindent">and, evidently a little sceptical as to the inviolable
κοσμιότης of the lady, makes various efforts to induce
her to commit herself, either by eating or drinking to
excess<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> (<i>Fr.</i> 1, 5), or by displaying her talents in a
questionable “song and dance.” (<i>Fr.</i> 6.) His efforts
seem, however, to be unsuccessful, and at the end
of the evening the hero is as hopelessly in love as
ever:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>dénouement</i> of this interesting little story
we do not know; let us hope it was a satisfactory
one.</p>

<p>In the <i>Agonis</i> of Alexis again, we find a girl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
remonstrating with her mother, who wishes her to
accept a rich but dissolute lover in preference to the
νεανίσκος of her choice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὦ μῆτερ, ἱκετεύω σε, μὴ ’πίσειέ μοι</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τὸν Μισγόλαν· οὐ γὰρ κιθαρῳδός εἰμ’ ἐγώ.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mother, however, insists, in spite of the young
man’s professions of (imaginary?) wealth (<i>Fr.</i> 2), in
carrying off her daughter to the rich lover’s house,
where, however, the hero also manages to turn up
and make some cutting remarks on the family
portraits (<i>Fr.</i> 3).<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> He then succeeds in making the
mother drunk (<i>Fr.</i> 4), and so, we are led to believe—for
the end is again veiled in obscurity—is enabled
to elude her vigilance.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Further evidence as to the character of this style
of art may be obtained by studying several of the
plays of Plautus, such as the <i>Truculentus</i>, the
<i>Mercator</i>, or the <i>Mostellaria</i>, which seem to have
been adapted directly from Greek works of this
class, without being in any way influenced by the
later romantic ideas.</p>

<p>But while the incidents which occur in the
individual plays are naturally of an endless variety,
certain broad features are recognisable throughout
this literature.</p>

<p>Firstly, not only is love for an Hetaera enthusiastically
praised, but it is specially described as the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
love in life worth loving. The advantage of the
Hetaera over the wife is such a stock subject, that
it will be unnecessary to do more than mention
one or two of the most striking passages in which
the feeling finds expression, such as that cited in
Athenaeus, xiii. 559 A, from the <i>Athamas</i> of
Amphis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">εἶτ’ οὐ γυναικός ἐστιν εὐνοϊκώτερον</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">γαμετῆς ἑταίρα; πολύ γε καὶ μάλ’ εἰκότως.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἡ μὲν νόμῳ γὰρ καταφρονοῦσ’ ἔνδον μένει,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἡ δ’ οἶδεν ὅτι ἢ τοῖς τρόποις ὠνητέος</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἄνθρωπός ἐστιν ἢ πρὸς ἄλλον ἀπιτέον.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or that quoted in the same place from the <i>Corinthiastes</i>
of Philetaerus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὡς τακερόν, ὦ Ζεῦ, καὶ μαλακὸν τὸ βλέμμ’ ἔχει.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">οὐκ ἐτὸς ἑταίρας ἱερόν ἐστι πανταχοῦ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀλλ’ οὐχὶ γαμετῆς οὐδαμοῦ τῆς Ἑλλάδος.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this is not all. The advantages of Hetaera-love
over adultery are expounded after a fashion
that cannot fail to be startling to anyone who has
not formed a clear conception of what “love” meant
in the Athens of Demosthenes. A striking instance
of this occurs in the <i>Nannion</i> of Eubulus,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and the
same idea is still further developed in the <i>Pentathlus</i>
of Xenarchus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>As for that “love of a man for a maid,” which
is, so to speak, the very essence of the love-element
in later Greek literature, it is simply ignored in
Middle Comedy. A girl that one is going to marry
has all the disadvantages of a wife, but for one thing.
While the wife <i>in esse</i> is, as a later writer feelingly
expresses it, “an immortal necessary evil,” and,
therefore, cannot be altogether escaped from, there
is no need to meet troubles halfway by drawing
attention to the wife <i>in posse</i>. Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we marry; and while we do so, let
us have no Alexandrian skeleton at the feast to
remind us of the fatal hour. And so, if the question
be asked, “What did the Middle Comedy writers
think of such love?” the answer is, “They did not
think of it at all.”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>And this will serve to introduce us to a further
question, in the answer to which lies the key to the
whole of this part of our subject. What is actually
meant by the “love” which we hear so often expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
for these Hetaerae? The answer may be
simple and brief: <i>ornari res ipsa vetat, contenta doceri</i>:
the love of the Middle Comedy is animal passion,
pure and simple; the Hetaera caters for the appetites
of the time in exactly the same way, even if in a
different sphere, as the cook and the fishmonger,
of whom we also hear so much, both to praise and
blame, in this literature.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Of love in the modern
sense of the word, of love as distinct from lust,
there is nowhere any suggestion in the writers of the
Middle Comedy. This fact is so patent to anyone
who is familiar with the plays of this period, that
one may, perhaps, be spared the trouble of its
illustration. If anyone is inclined to doubt it, let him
open the third volume of Meineke’s <i>Comic Fragments</i>
at random, and read; he will soon be satisfied.</p>

<p>When this is the case, it is not surprising that we
find “Platonic” love held up to consistent ridicule
during the time of the Middle Comedy. A
sufficiently striking example of this method is the
passage quoted in Athenaeus, xiii. 563 C, from the
<i>Dithyrambus</i> of Amphis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">τί φῄς; σὺ ταυτὶ προσδοκᾷς πείθειν ἐμέ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ὡς ἔστ’ ἐραστὴς ὅστις, ὡραῖον φιλῶν,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τρόπων ἐραστής ἐστι, τὴν ὄψιν παρείς;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἄφρων γ’ ἀληθῶς. κ.τ.λ.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[<i>Fr.</i> 2.]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the clearest proof of all is that furnished by
the fact that Plato himself, and Sappho, whose style
of love was, as we have already had occasion to
observe,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> recognised as similar in spirit to that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
advocated by the philosopher, are, perhaps, the two
favourite butts for the wit of the Middle Comedy.
That the <i>Plato</i> of Aristophon, like the <i>Hedychares</i>
of Theopompus, of which we have already spoken,
and the <i>Sapphos</i> of Antiphanes, Amphis, Ephippus,
and Timocles, were, at least some of them, in part
devoted to this subject, it seems only reasonable to
believe, while sporadic allusions to the matter are,
of course, sufficiently common. The one possible
exception to this general rule appears in the <i>Helene</i>
of Alexis, where a character is introduced upholding
the Platonic view of love; but it would be bold, in
the face of so much evidence on the other side, to
assert that this isolated statement in any way indicates
the general tone of the comedy in question.
It is far more likely that the champion of these
views (perhaps Theseus<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>) was made to see the error
of his ways and repent his lost opportunities before
the play was out.</p>

<p>And akin in spirit to the above is the tendency,
so common that it hardly needs special illustration,
to throw ridicule on the married state and on family
life in general.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> When the man, who is called the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
originator of the erotic element in Middle Comedy,
can write words like these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὅστις γαμεῖν βουλεύετ’, οὐ βουλεύεται</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and mean them, there can be little doubt as to the
tendency of that erotic element which he was the
first to introduce. In fact, not only is marriage a
favourite subject of ridicule, but it is one on which
the writers of this period make some of their happiest
remarks. There are few things in Antiphanes as
good as the passage in the <i>Philopator</i>, where one
man, meeting another, enquires after a friend, and
hears that he has got married.</p>

<h3>VIII. <span class="smcap">The New Comedy.</span></h3>

<p>The feeling on passing from the Middle to the
New Comedy is like the fresh air on coming out
of the bar of a public-house. The Middle Comedy
is the last decaying branch of the old literature; the
romantic New Comedy is one of the earliest and most
vigorous offshoots of that new literature which sprang
from the genius of Antimachus, and has continued to
the present day. In the Middle Comedy, we are still
face to face with the women of typical Athens, with
the women of Aristophanes, at best with the women
of Euripides,—and with the way in which typical
Athens treated these women; in the New Comedy
this is changed, and woman—the woman that can
be loved as wife and mother—steps into her true
place as object of, and partner in, the intensest and
the purest passions of which humanity is capable.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Middle Comedy
treatment, of women and love for women, had four
main characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>(1) The glorification of the Hetaera and of love
for the Hetaera.</p>

<p>(2) The purely sensual nature of the love thus
extolled.</p>

<p>(3) The ridicule of all love that was not sensual.</p>

<p>(4) The ridicule of family-life.</p>

<p>The New Comedy flatly contradicts every one
of these principles. The love of which it treats is
love for a <i>virgin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and the consummation of this
love is <i>marriage</i>. Such love is by no means purely
sensual; indeed, at times it is almost of a “Platonic”
character. And lastly, not only is the sanctity of
marriage strictly insisted upon, and the advantages
of marriage as a system strongly maintained, but
the family relations, anyhow among the younger
generation, are often of a very pleasant character.</p>

<p>In fact, while the action of the Middle Comedy
is concerned with a love, the consummation of which
is a temporary sensual gratification, the action of
the New Comedy is supplied by the efforts of its
heroes and their adherents, to secure that the love
which occupies so much of their thoughts may be
made at once legitimate and permanent. It was
New Comedy that first introduced on the stage the
love of a life, as opposed to the love of an hour.
If anyone were to ask what was the chief merit of
Menander, the answer would be that he was the
first to show the Athenians that “love for ever,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
with which every poetaster and novel-reader has now
been familiar for so many centuries.</p>

<p>But the differences between the treatment of
women in the new literature, and that to which they
were exposed in the literature we have just been
studying, will be most readily made clear if we
proceed at once to the detailed examination of
the former.</p>

<p>The first and most prominent feature of the New
Comedy treatment of the love of men for women
is its insistance on marriage—that is to say, on a
definite guarantee of permanence and constancy—as
the one proper consummation of such love. In
fact, as we have already had occasion to observe
in another place, the idealisation of marriage is the
basis of Greek romance.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>This insistance on marriage is, of course, most
strikingly exemplified in the typical New Comedy
plot, which is sufficiently familiar to every student of
the Latin comedians. Thus, in five of these Latin
plays, the <i>Heauton Timorumenos</i> (of Menander),
the <i>Phormio</i> (of Apollodorus), the <i>Rudens</i> (of
Diphilus), the <i>Curculio</i>, and the <i>Poenulus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> the story
is of exactly the kind that subsequently appears
in the Greek novel—a young man falls in love
with a virgin, and, after various misfortunes which
threaten to separate the pair, they are eventually
married, and live happily ever afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>On this class of plot it is unnecessary to dwell,
except that it may be worth while just to draw
attention to the extremely passionate nature of the
love which makes these young men so anxious to
marry. The modern reader would instinctively
expect that the confinement of love to these
legitimate and, as one would now consider them,
commonplace channels, would inevitably lead to a
lessening of its charm, and a diminution of its force.
As a matter of fact, the result was the very reverse.
Not only has the character of man’s love for woman
changed, but this love has developed an intensity
of poetry and passion which has never belonged
to it before.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Instances are easy to find; the most
striking one is perhaps shown us at the meeting of
Phaedromus and Planesium, in the <i>Curculio</i> (i. 3):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Pl.</span> tene me, amplectere ergo! <span class="smcap">Ph.</span> hoc etiam est quamobrem cupiam vivere.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quia te prohibet herus, clam hero potior. <span class="smcap">Pl.</span> prohibet, nec prohibere quit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nec prohibebit, nisi mors meum animum abs te abalienaverit.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>But there are others, almost equally forcible, in
the <i>Rudens</i> (iv. 8)—where particular enthusiasm is
expressed at the prospect of marriage, as opposed
to the relation which had previously been the lover’s
highest possible ideal,—the <i>Poenulus</i> (v. 4, 49)<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>But another and equally important type of story
is that in which the man first seduces the woman,
and then subsequently marries her. Plays of this
description are the <i>Andria</i>, the <i>Eunuchus</i>, the
<i>Adelphi</i> (all by Menander), the <i>Aulularia</i>, and the
<i>Cistellaria</i>.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Of these, the <i>Cistellaria</i> is different from the rest.
Here, the girl Silenium, who, though supposed to
be the daughter of a <i>lena</i>, has been brought up as
a virgin (i. 3, 24), is induced by a promise of marriage
to live with the man Alcesimarchus, a promise which
is afterwards fulfilled only after a considerable delay.
(i. 1, 90-100.) In the other four cases, however—and
this is very important—the promise of marriage
is subsequent to the seduction, and takes the form,
not of an inducement to, but of a reparation for
the latter. The lover regards the seduction as a
crime, for which he is willing to make amends to
the utmost of his power, while at the same time
he is anxious to perpetuate and legalise his amour.
He therefore adopts what we are accustomed in
modern times to call an “honourable course,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
offers marriage to the woman whom he has loved
and still loves. The importance of this feature is twofold—firstly,
the close association thus brought about
between marriage and love of the most “romantic”
and unconventional description; and secondly, the
perpetuation and legalisation of a form of love which
is obviously by nature temporary and illegitimate.
And thus the love-stories of the New Comedy may
be said to begin where those of the Middle Comedy
end; while the heroes of the latter are concerned
with achieving the temporary satisfaction of their
sensual desires, the heroes of the former are occupied
in striving to make permanent atonement for the
indiscretions which such desires have led them to
commit.</p>

<p>To quote instances of what has been said: in the
<i>Andria</i> the promise of marriage is distinctly an act
of reparation, which the lover feels himself in duty
bound to make. This is evident from the argument
of Sulpicius Apollinaris,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and from various passages
in the play.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The same is the case in the <i>Adelphi</i>.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
Here Aeschinus, as soon as he considers what he
has done, comes to the mother of Pamphila, and
begs with tears to be allowed to marry her by way
of reparation.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> In the <i>Aulularia</i>, the petition of
Lyconides to the miser Euclio is animated by a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
similar spirit.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> In the <i>Eunuchus</i> (which is, it must
be remembered, the love-story of a boy of sixteen)<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>,
there is no opportunity for any such behaviour on
the part of Chaerea, though his sincere regret (ii. 3,
33 <i>seqq.</i>), and his enthusiasm when the possibility
of marriage becomes apparent (v. 8, 1 <i>seqq.</i>), show
clearly enough that he is not intended to be an
exception to the general rule.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the feeling,
which prompts the various characters of whom we
have spoken to make reparation for their wrongdoing,
is merely a feeling of repentance, or a regard
for public opinion. It is love, and love of a most
passionate kind, that makes them so anxious to
marry the women they have wronged. Of the
enthusiasm of the hero of the <i>Eunuchus</i> at the
prospect of marriage we have already spoken; in
the <i>Adelphi</i>, Aeschinus is equally elated under
similar circumstances;<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> in the <i>Aulularia</i>, the anxiety
and persistency of Lyconides are evidently inspired
by the same feeling;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> in the <i>Andria</i>, Pamphilus
protests that nothing short of death will divide him
from Glycerium.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> That love which the Middle
Comedy could not conceive of as outliving its
sensual gratification, appears in the New Comedy,
not weakened, but strengthened by time, and
obstacles only serve to make the lover more determined
to perpetuate and to legalise those emotions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
which had, to a previous generation, owed their chief
charm to their freedom from the restraints of constancy
and propriety.</p>

<p>In the <i>Hecyra</i> again, it is by marriage that, through
a strange coincidence, the hero is eventually able to
repair the wrong done to the heroine. In the <i>Stichus</i>,
too, the plot turns on the constancy of two wives to
their absent husbands,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> while, in the <i>Trinummus</i>,
there seems strong reason to believe, that it is not
all love for Lesbonicus which makes Lysiteles so
anxious to marry the former’s sister.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>To this evidence from the plays themselves may
be added some further evidence of a more general
kind. Marriage is mentioned by the anonymous
author of the epigram in the <i>C. I. G.</i> 6083, as the
most characteristic feature of Menander’s plays—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">φαιδρὸν ἑταῖρον Ἔρωτος ὁρᾷς, σειρῆνα θεάτρων,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">τόνδε Μένανδρον, ἀεὶ κρᾶτα πνκαζόμενον,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">οὕνεκ’ ἄρ’ ἀνθρώπους ἱλαρὸν βίον ἐξεδίδαξεν,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">ἡδύνας σκηνὴν δράμασι πᾶσι γάμῳ.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Still more emphatic is the testimony of Plutarch,
who asserts (<i>Sympos.</i> vii. 712 C) that Menander is
peculiarly suited for married men to hear and read—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>ἔχει δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐρωτικὰ παρ’ αὐτῷ καιρὸν πεπωκόσιν ἀνθρώποις
καὶ ἀναπαυσαμένοις μετὰ μικρὸν ἀπιοῦσι παρὰ τὰς ἑαυτῶν
γυναῖκας ... αἵ τε φθοραὶ τῶν παρθένων εἰς γάμον ἐπιεικῶς
καταστρέφουσι. κ.τ.λ.</p>

</div>

<p>Indeed, the essentially “proper” character of the
Menandrean drama is emphasised by more than one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
ancient writer. That Comedy could be anything but
indecent was a revelation to Athens of the fourth
century, and it was a revelation for which she does
not seem to have been particularly grateful; but the
fact that it was a writer whose works were fit “pueris
virginibusque legi,” who revolutionized the dramatic
art, is one that a modern student of that revolution
cannot afford to forget.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Two of the plays mentioned above, the <i>Hecyra</i>
and the <i>Stichus</i>, lead naturally to the consideration
of another feature of the New Comedy treatment
of marriage—a feature which, though less strongly
marked than that of which we have just been
speaking, is yet, if one considers what Greek feeling
had previously been on this matter, perhaps even
more remarkable. Not only is marriage held up as
the lover’s ideal, but the actual married state is
described as a state of happiness, and married
people, even those who have been married for some
time, are introduced to us as strongly attached to
one another. How complete a revolution in Greek
feeling such a state as this implies, need hardly be
emphasised.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Yet, in the <i>Stichus</i>, we have a plot
based on the determination of two women to remain
faithful to their husbands (who have been absent for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
three years) in spite of the efforts of their father to
induce them to do otherwise; they insist on remaining
faithful, though their husbands are poor (Plaut.
<i>Stich.</i> i. 2, 75 <i>seqq.</i>), and though they are uncertain
whether their devotion is returned (i. 1, 36 <i>seqq.</i>). In
the <i>Hecyra</i> again, it is the behaviour of Philumena
after marriage which wins her husband’s heart (Ter.
<i>Hec.</i> i. 2, 85 <i>seqq.</i>)—a remarkably modern form of
love-story.</p>

<p>Various fragments, too, of Menander have a
similar import, such as the famous passage from
the <i>Misogynes</i> on the advantages of marriage—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">ἐλθόντ’ εἰς νόσον</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τὸν ἔχοντα ταύτην ἐθεράπευσεν ἐπιμελῶς,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">ἔθαψε, περιέστειλεν οἰκείως. (<i>Fr.</i> 1, 9.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or Menand. <i>Incert.</i> 73, where the husband takes up
the cudgels in his wife’s behalf. <i>Incert.</i> 101, again,
dwells on the close relationship existing between
man and wife—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">οἰκεῖον οὕτως οὐδέν ἐστιν, ὦ Λάχης,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Incert.</i> 100 points out that a wife must rule her
husband by love—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἕν ἐστ’ ἀληθὲς φίλτρον, εὐγνώμων τρόπος.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τούτῳ κατακρατεῖν ἀνδρὸς εἴωθεν γυνή,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and a careful reader will have no difficulty in finding
other more or less important examples of the
same spirit, both in Menander and in the Latin
Comedians.</p>

<p>One important exception there is, of course, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
this state of affairs, and that is the relation between
the old men and their wives. The types of the hen-pecked
husband and the Xanthippe-like wife are too
familiar to need illustration. But here it is to be
observed, that the husbands who appear in this
position, are always old or elderly men, and this fact
is probably not without its significance. In describing
his elderly married men as unhappy, Menander was
ridiculing, not marriage, but the <i>mariages de convenance</i>
which had, before his time, been the regular
thing at Athens. “These men are unhappy,” says
Menander, “not because they are married, but
because they have married wives whom they never
loved, and whom they chose merely because of their
money, or to please their relations. If they had
married for love, the case might well have been
different.” And thus the hen-pecked husband, who
belongs to the old <i>régime</i>, is only a further argument
in favour of the romantic love-matches of which
Menander approved.</p>

<p>Of course the matter did not stop here. It was so
easy to raise a laugh with a row between husband
and wife, that Comedy was sure not to abandon the
subject, even after its <i>raison d’être</i> had disappeared;
and a modern audience, we know, is just as ready to
laugh at the husband who has lost his latch-key as
were the Athenians of the fourth century. But the
point to be remembered is, that a pair of characters
like Chremes and Sostrata in the <i>Heauton Timorumenus</i>,
or Laches and Sostrata in the <i>Hecyra</i>,
furnishes no real argument against the view that
Menander and his followers of the New Comedy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
regarded marriage, if properly entered upon, as a
state of happiness.</p>

<p>Another exception, and one that is perhaps in
reality a more important one, is furnished by
Menander’s <i>Misogynes</i>, a work which gained very
great popularity, doubtless owing to the way in
which it appealed to the lower instincts of the
audience whom its author was trying to educate up;
but here it has to be observed that, in the first place,
as the play is lost, it is impossible to say what the
actual <i>dénouement</i> was; while, secondly, there was no
reason why a man of Menander’s versatile genius
should not for once treat the subject of married life
in an unusual manner, without in any way abandoning
his general views on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>A further feature of the New Comedy treatment
of marriage is the universal respect for its sanctity.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
The adulterer, who is the favourite hero of mediaeval
romance, is here invariably held up to contempt and
hatred. The most familiar instance of this is, of
course, the story in the <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> of Plautus,
but it is far from being an isolated one. The <i>Halieis</i>
of Menander evidently treated of a somewhat similar
subject,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> which appears once more in the <i>Eunuchus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
In the <i>Andria</i> again, Charinus is horror-stricken at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the idea of committing adultery with the woman he
loves, though, when accused of seducing the same
woman, his only regret is that he cannot plead guilty
to the charge.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> An even more remarkable instance,
and one perhaps without parallel, is furnished by the
<i>Hecyra</i>, where the Hetaera Bacchis asserts that she
had refused to admit her lover, Pamphilus, as soon
as she learned that he was married.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> It may be
argued, of course, that she did this out of pique, but
the very cordial nature of the meeting between the
two (Ter. <i>Hec.</i> v. 4, 16, <i>seqq.</i>), and the fact that
Bacchis knew that her lover had abandoned her
sorely against his will (i. 2, 45 <i>seqq.</i>), and was still
devoted to her (i. 2, 82), seem to suggest that this is
not the most natural explanation of her conduct.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>The passages just described may serve to introduce
us to a further feature of our subject—a feature
in which the New Comedy is, if possible, even more
remarkably unlike the Middle Comedy than in those
which have already been discussed. In the Middle
Comedy, as we have already had frequent occasion
to observe, the wife and the husband are invariably
held up to ridicule when compared with the Hetaera
and her lover; in the New Comedy we may find this
position exactly reversed. Instances are rare, (as is
indeed to be expected, when we consider, in the first
place, the strong current of popular feeling on the
subject, and, secondly, the personal relations between
the leading writers of the New Comedy and the
prominent Hetaerae of the time,) but they do unquestionably
occur. The most striking example is
perhaps that in the <i>Heauton Timorumenus</i>, where not
only is the Hetaera contrasted unfavourably with the
virgin, (as she herself admits,)<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> but her lover is made
consistently ridiculous as compared with the lover
who contemplates marriage, and in the end comes
off badly in the extreme. Very similar evidence is
furnished by the <i>Hecyra</i>. In the struggle for the
love of Pamphilus, which takes place in that play
between the wife and the Hetaera, the former is
completely successful, and her victory is gained by
sheer amiability of temper (Ter. <i>Hec.</i> i. 2, 85 <i>seqq.</i>);
indeed, so charming is she, that the Hetaera is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
driven in the end to congratulate her husband on his
good fortune in having married her. (v. 4, 22.) And
this victory of the wife becomes the more remarkable,
when we observe that the Hetaera is evidently
intended to be a very favourable specimen of her
class, in every way deserving of the lover she is
compelled to lose.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>While on this point, it may not be amiss to
remark that it is by no means impossible that the
famous <i>Thais</i> of Menander really belonged to this
class of plays, and that the Hetaera, who gives her
name to the piece, is intended as a <i>parody</i> on the
typical Hetaera of Middle Comedy. This view,
which is not improbable in itself, receives some
support from the mock-heroic tone of <i>Fr.</i> 1 of the
<i>Thais</i>,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and still more from Mart. xiv. 187;<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> but
cannot, of course, be regarded as more than a
possible suggestion.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Of mere vulgar ridicule or abuse of the ordinary
Hetaera, as heartless,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> mercenary,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and the like,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
there is, of course, enough and to spare; but it
would be unjustifiable to claim expressions such as
these as distinctive of New Comedy, in the face of
passages like Epicrates, <i>Antilais</i>, 2, or Anaxilas,
<i>Neottis</i>, 1. Menander indeed makes a more serious
charge, perhaps, when one of his characters asserts
that an Hetaera cannot be good, for she makes a
trade of sin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">οὐδέποθ’ ἑταίρα τοῦ καλῶς πεφρόντικεν,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἣ τὸ κακόηθες πρόσοδον εἴωθεν ποιεῖν.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(<i>Incert.</i> 107.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is, however, an isolated expression, for Menand.
<i>Incert.</i> 36, at first sight similar, is really different.</p>

<p>But, though the writers of the New Comedy are
careful, as a general rule, to avoid anything that
might have seemed too severe a stricture on that
system of Hetaera-worship which was so distinctive
a feature of the age, they are unmistakably emphatic
in their assertion that such sensual love is not the
only kind of love of which a man is capable.
The chivalrous manner in which the lover of New
Comedy often behaves to his lady, is one of the
clearest features of the change which the authors of
the romantic school had succeeded in bringing about
on the Athenian stage.</p>

<p>At once the most striking and the most perplexing
illustration of this is furnished by the character
of Thrasonides in Menander’s celebrated play, the
<i>Misumenus</i>. This Thrasonides, who belongs to the
regular type of the <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>, is in love with
a slave-girl, whom he has obtained in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
his wars;<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> but he has so disgusted her with his
boasting (like Leontichus in Lucian) that she has
conceived a most violent hatred for him. He then,
though she is his slave, and though his passion is
so great that he cannot sleep for thinking of her,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
instead of using his undoubted power to accomplish
what he wishes,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> tries every means that he can
imagine in order to conciliate her, “sending her
gifts, and weeping, and praying,”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> that she may look
more favourably upon him.</p>

<p>The <i>dénouement</i> of the play is lost. It is not
impossible that in the end the slave-girl was identified
as an Athenian, and carried off by some more
acceptable lover, who thus profited by the chivalrous
conduct of his rival, or she may even have turned
out to be the soldier’s sister, as in the <i>Curculio</i> or the
<i>Epidicus</i>, in either of which cases the scruples of
Thrasonides would be necessary to the working of
the plot. But all this is, for our present purpose, of
no importance. What is of importance, and of the
utmost importance, is the fact that Thrasonides,
though he is so violently in love with the girl, will
not make use of his unquestioned power to gratify
this passion, because of the dislike which she feels
for him. In fact, his love is of such a kind that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
does not merely want to satisfy a sensual appetite—he
wants to be loved. Unless he can feel that she
loves him, none of those privileges, which, to the
ordinary Hetaera-lover of the day, would have been
of themselves the complete consummation of love,
are of any value to him. ἔξεστί μοι τοῦτο καὶ
βούλομαι, οὐ ποιῶ δέ.</p>

<p>The aim of the lover is not to gratify himself, but
to inspire love.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> That we are here face to face with
a form of love which is not only actually absent from
Middle Comedy, but is by nature absolutely foreign
to that literature and could not possibly appear in it,
is too obvious to need further emphasis.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>This much, then, is clear; but there remains a most
perplexing question, which, though it is a little aside
of our immediate subject, is yet too interesting to be
passed by altogether. Why is it Thrasonides, the
<i>Miles Gloriosus</i> whom all the Comedians are banded
together to ridicule, who appears as the most
chivalrous lover of the whole of New Comedy?<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
Why is a man who is universally regarded as a
fool, made to give expression to such elevated sentiments,
and to follow such a noble line of conduct?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
The first explanation that suggests itself is, of
course, “Because he is a fool.” This view is certainly
advanced in a passage of Plutarch, where
Thrasonides is compared to the miser who starves
rather than make use of the food he has in the house,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
and seems to find favour too with Thrasonides’ own
slave.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> But this explanation is not a very satisfactory
one, somehow. However great a fool Menander
might wish to make of the mercenary soldier of the
time, this does not seem the natural line for his folly
to take, nor was it the line, as we know from historical
evidence, that the folly of these people
actually did as a rule take. A Pyrgopolinices must,
one would have thought, have been a far more
familiar figure to citizens who had enjoyed a Macedonian
occupation, than a Thrasonides. One might,
perhaps, imagine that the behaviour of Alexander to
the wife and daughters of Darius—behaviour which
was regarded in Greece as somewhat remarkable<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>—had
suggested the character of Thrasonides, for, after
all, the ideal soldier of the age, whether for good or
evil, is always Alexander; only it seems doubtful
whether a single action of an unusual kind could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
serve to form so constant a type as the chivalrous
soldier-lover. At one time I thought that, as the
soldier of New Comedy has generally served in
Asia, perhaps he might be supposed to have imported
his advanced romantic ideas from one of
those Greek Asiatic cities which were, as we know,
the original home of Greek romance, and indeed of
all important developments of Greek erotic literature.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
But there is to modern notions so great an
incongruity in the idea of, say, the Colonel of a
West India regiment so influenced by the latest
school of literature as to model his life on it, that,
though such a character would not, perhaps, have
seemed so absurd to the Greeks as it does to us,
still, in the absence of all definite evidence, I have
preferred not to lay undue stress upon what is, after
all, entirely a matter of conjecture. Indeed, the
question remains to me a very obscure one, and I
cannot at present see any satisfactory solution of it.</p>

<p>But, whatever may have been the causes which
led to the creation of this particular character, the
soldier-lover of a more or less Thrasonides type is
an unquestionable feature of New Comedy. Besides
the hero of the <i>Misumenus</i>, of whom we have spoken,
in the <i>Sicyonius</i> (also by Menander) we find another
soldier, Stratophanes, who buys a slave-girl, and then
treats her as if she were a free woman.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> To the
same class of feeling, though expressed in a somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
different way, belongs the remorse which the
soldier Polemon (in the <i>Periceiromene</i> of Menander)
feels for the wrong he has done to his αἰχμαλώτῳ
ἐρωμένῃ.</p>

<p>A case in some respects similar, though in others
different, is that of the soldier Stratippocles, in the
<i>Epidicus</i>, who falls in love with his captive, but
does not touch her.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The differences, of course,
here are that, firstly, the play belongs to Middle
Comedy, its moral being that Stratippocles will
be happier with his <i>fidicina</i> than with the girl of
high birth, for whom he has formed the chivalrous
attachment;<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> while, secondly, the continence of the
hero is not so much a feature of his character as a
necessity for the development of the plot; and,
thirdly, the soldier is here not a mercenary, but an
Athenian citizen, who has been fighting against the
Thebans. But though, therefore, the case of the
<i>Epidicus</i> does not belong to the same category as
those previously discussed, the association in it
of the soldier with chivalrous behaviour towards
women is yet worthy of notice, and, even if only
a coincidence, is still an interesting one.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Apart, too, from these very remarkable instances,
there are not a few passages scattered about in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
remains of the New Comedy which serve to show
that the “love,” of which there is so much talk in
that literature, is not the merely animal passion of
an earlier period. Of these, a striking one is that
preserved in Plutarch, <i>ap.</i> Stob. <i>Flor.</i> lxiii. 34:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>τῶν Μενάνδρου δραμάτων, says Plutarch there, οὐκ ἴσως
ἁπάντων ἓν συνεκτικόν ἐστιν ὁ ἔρως, οἷον πνεῦμα κοινὸν

</div>

<p>That is: Menander, a writer familiar with love in
its most passionate forms (θιασώτην καὶ ὀργιαστήν),
gives us a sober and serious view of the matter.
After expressing his astonishment at the ways of
lovers, he furnishes us with a realistic account of
love as it actually is (ὥσπερ ἐστὶν ἅμα λαλεῖ),<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and
then proceeds to investigate its causes. For a
moment he is puzzled, and questions with himself,
but soon he finds the true answer. καιρός ἐστιν ἡ
νόσος ψυχῆς. Love is an affection of the soul as
distinct from the body, and has only an accidental
connection with the latter.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Equally forcible, though in another way, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
passage from the <i>Poenulus</i>. The lover and his
slave are watching the two girls, and the slave
expresses his utter contempt for his master’s
“Platonic” affection, to which the latter answers
that he loves Adelphasium as he loves the gods.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
Another case is in the <i>Curculio</i>, where the love of
Phaedromus for Planesium is fed on nothing more
substantial than kisses;<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> another in the <i>Hecyra</i>,
where it is distinctly pointed out that the love of
Pamphilus for his wife is induced by other than
sensual considerations.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Other instances, of more
or less significance, every reader of the Latin
comedians will be able to supply for himself; and
it is further worth observing that when a New
Comedy character, as occasionally does happen, is
made to speak slightingly of “Platonic” love, such
a character is always a slave, never a person of
refinement.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>To proceed to the final point of essential difference
between Middle and New Comedy, it will be remembered
that, in the former class of literature,
family life and the mutual relations of members
of a family were among the stock subjects of
ridicule, and that no remarks expressive of any
other views on this matter are to be found there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
at any rate before a very late period.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Family life,
as depicted in the New Comedy, is by no means
ideal; indeed, as we have already had occasion
to remark, the unhappy relations between husband
and elderly wife are, under certain circumstances,
a favourite subject of ridicule, even with Menander.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
But yet instances to the contrary are to be found,
and are, in fact, by no means very uncommon. Not
to speak of the cases of devotion of wife to husband
and husband to wife—such as those in the <i>Stichus</i>,
&amp;c., already sufficiently discussed<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>—the relations
between father and children, and, still more, mother
and children,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> are often described as of the most
delightful character.</p>

<p>Of the former, there are interesting examples in
Menand. <i>Incert.</i> 59:</p>

<p>The charming interview between the father and

further, equally striking instance.</p>

<p>Of the latter relation, that between mother and
children, there is a good instance in this same play
(i. 2, 51), where, after the father has propounded

<p>A still more striking case is that in the <i>Hecyra</i>,
where the mother of Pamphilus, thinking that it is
her presence which renders it impossible for her
son’s wife to live with him, resolves to sacrifice
herself, and go into voluntary exile into the country.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
The same idea, though less pleasantly expressed, is

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<h3>IX. <span class="smcap">The Origins of the Romantic Comedy.</span></h3>

<p>The above investigation into the nature of New
Comedy, and into the points of difference between
it and the earlier literature, leads naturally to the
consideration of a further and final question—that
of the origin of these differences which are so
strikingly apparent. We have seen that the romantic
New Comedy differs entirely in its treatment of
women from every form of dramatic art which had
preceded it.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In fact, we have seen that, while the
Middle Comedy belongs still entirely to the first or
classical period of Greek literature, the New Comedy,
with its striking romantic features, belongs essentially
to that second period, which it is usual to call the
Alexandrian, and forms, indeed, one of the departments
of literature in which the romantic tendencies
of that period can be studied to the best advantage.
What we have to consider is therefore this: How
did Athenian Comedy acquire these romantic features
which are so conspicuously absent from its earlier
phases? when did it acquire them? and to whom
was the acquisition due?</p>

<p>The last of these three questions may be best
considered first. There seems every reason to believe
that this introduction of the romantic element was
due to Menander rather than to Philemon.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
can be no question that of the two writers, Philemon
is the less distinctively romantic. Of the typical
New Comedy love-stories preserved in Plautus and
Terence, not one professes to be derived from him.
The allusions to women altogether are proportionately
much fewer in his fragments than in those
of Menander; while a large proportion, again, of
such allusions as there are, are either references to
Hetaerae, or else belong to the old-fashioned misogyny
of Middle Comedy. The detailed examination
of his style of art, which occurs in the <i>Florida</i> of
Apuleius, is altogether strongly suggestive of Middle
Comedy;<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> indeed, Apuleius actually describes him
as “mediae comoediae scriptor.” It is further to
be remarked that the number of coarse allusions
to women is proportionately far greater in Philemon
than in Menander. Indeed, the whole study of
Philemon’s treatment of women leaves one with the
impression, not only that he was at heart a follower
of the old school, but that even when he did for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
any reason adopt the romantic principle, he developed
this principle from a more sensual point of view than
Menander. That this tendency to coarseness is in
sympathy with the earlier spirit of Athenian comedy,
but is entirely foreign to its romantic development,
need hardly be emphasised, after all that has
already been said on the subject. And it may not
be altogether beside the question here, to call attention
to Philemon’s invariable pessimism—pessimism
most characteristic of a conservative mind in an age
of progress, but hardly consistent with such qualities
as would be required of the originator of a great
artistic and social revolution.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Furthermore, Philemon
is regularly spoken of as the rival of Menander;<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> the
reverse is never the case, notwithstanding the fact
that the relative ages of the two playwrights would
have made the latter the more natural way of putting
the case. Again, the much greater success of Philemon
at the time, notwithstanding the well-nigh
unanimous contrary verdict of subsequent ages,<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
seems to show clearly that he was the more old-fashioned
of the two; for, as is well known, originality
is seldom very welcome on the stage. And lastly,
the very large proportion of Philemon’s works which
appear to have belonged to Middle Comedy pure
and simple—a point which will be further discussed
directly—seems to be further evidence that this was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
his natural <i>métier</i>, and that it was only a spirit of
rivalry with Menander which made him turn his
attention to a style of art with which he had no real
sympathy.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> As for the <i>Hypobolimaeus</i>, that proves
nothing, for there is no evidence whatever by which
to fix the date of this resuscitation of the <i>Cocalus</i>
of Aristophanes; indeed, if anything, it rather
suggests that Philemon found such subjects so little
congenial, that he had to borrow his materials, instead
of being able to produce them himself.</p>

<p>All this, it may be argued, proves little as to the
claims of Menander over Philemon. Indeed, it may
even be urged that the very fact that Philemon is
the less distinctively romantic of the two, renders
it probable that the first introduction of the romantic
element was due to him. But such an argument,
though at first sight plausible enough, rests on an
imperfect comprehension of the real nature of the
romantic principle in Greek comedy. Were this
principle a direct development of tendencies characteristic
of the earlier phases of the literature, it would
doubtless be right to assume that its first appearance
in any tangible shape would be of an unemphatic
and tentative kind; but the romantic principle is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
such development of previous tendencies. It is not a
development, but a regeneration; it is not a growth
from within, but an annex from without. Whatever
anyone may suppose to be the origin of the romantic
element, no one with any acquaintance with the
subject is likely to wish to maintain that the virgin-love
of New Comedy is developed out of the
Hetaera-worship of its predecessor on the stage.
Indeed, there can be little doubt that, so far from
New Comedy appealing to those tastes which Middle
Comedy had fostered, its remarkable success was
in great part due to a strong reaction against the
latter. And thus there is every reason to believe
that, when once the new emotion found expression
on the stage, such expression was immediately clear
and unmistakable; and that therefore, in looking for
the originator of the movement, one must look for
that writer of the period whose works exhibit the
romantic features most strongly and consistently,
and must regard those other writers, in whom such
features are less prominent, as more or less unwilling
imitators. And if this be so, there can be little real
doubt as to the validity of Menander’s claim.</p>

<p>The next question to be considered is—When was
this introduction of the romantic element into Greek
comedy first brought about? We know that Philemon
began to exhibit in 330, and that the date of
Menander’s first play is 322; but these facts do not
of themselves furnish any information as to the
origin of New Comedy proper. For it is an unquestionable
fact, and one of the greatest importance in
this connection, that both Philemon and Menander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
wrote plays which are not romantic, and which
belong, therefore, to Middle, rather than to New
Comedy. And on this fact hinges the whole question
of the date of the introduction of the romantic
element into Athenian Comedy.</p>

<p>Of the ninety-seven plays of Philemon, which
Platonius states were in his time extant,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> hardly
fifty titles are preserved, and of these, well-nigh a
third obviously belong to what were evidently
Middle Comedies.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> When we consider how extremely
probable it is that the majority of the plays
now entirely lost belonged also to this class (for it
is obvious that a later age would tend to preserve
such plays as were in harmony with the romantic
tastes then prevailing, rather than those that were
not), it becomes clear that a very large proportion
of the plays of Philemon were not New Comedies
at all. With Menander the same is to a certain
extent, though not in an equal degree, also true.
Of about a hundred plays that he produced during
the thirty-two years of his literary activity, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
a dozen or so, presumably unsuccessful efforts of
his earlier years, are entirely lost, some twenty
besides, of those whose titles we know, must be
ranked with the old, rather than with the new
form of dramatic art.</p>

<p>Now when we further reflect that it is not probable
that, after a writer has once taken to a new and successful
development of art, he will then fall back
again to any considerable extent upon the old, and
that therefore the Middle Comedies of Menander,
and also of Philemon,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> belong, in all probability, to
their earlier period and are anterior to the introduction
of the romantic element, it becomes obvious
that the date of the introduction of this element
into Comedy, (that is to say, the date of the birth of
New Comedy,) must be put considerably later than
is usually done, and that, instead of fixing this date
at 330, or even at 322, we must rather fix it somewhere
between the years 315 and 310. For assuming,
as we seem in every way justified in doing, that
about a quarter of the plays of Menander belonged
in spirit still to Middle Comedy, and that his rate
of production increased rather than diminished with
advancing years, a simple calculation will enable us
to put the date within these limits.</p>

<p>Granted then that the introduction of the romantic
element into Comedy was due to Menander, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
took place about the year 312, there remains the
final question, Where did Menander get the idea
from? It has, I trust, been made sufficiently clear
by this time that he did not derive it from his predecessors
in Comedy, nor yet from his favourite model
Euripides. He may, of course, have evolved it independently
for himself, but this, seeing that a
similar conclusion had been arrived at some hundred
years before, is not very probable. It has already
been demonstrated that the romantic idea, (that is to
say, the idea that a woman is a worthy object for a
man’s love, and that such love may well be the chief,
if not the only, aim of a man’s life,) had originally
been propounded by Antimachus of Colophon at the
end of the fifth century<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>; it seems, therefore, well-nigh
certain that this idea must have been communicated
in some way to Menander from Antimachus, and
the only point that remains to be considered is the
probable method of this communication.</p>

<p>It is possible that the influence may have been
direct. It is possible that the accident of a copy of
the <i>Lyde</i> coming into Menander’s hands may have
suggested to him the idea which he subsequently
developed with such success. It is possible, and, in
the absence of evidence, one way or the other, it
would be bold to assert that it was not the case;
but, at the same time, it seems on the whole more
probable that the influence was of a different kind,
and that Menander’s attention was first called to
the views propounded by Antimachus through the
medium of some third person. While it is, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
course, futile to expect proof in such a case as this,
there is, perhaps, one personality among those we
know belonging to the period, in favour of which,
rather than of any other, the evidence seems to tend.
This is Asclepiades, the originator of the erotic
epigram, and a poet of great influence upon various
contemporary writers. It is true that it is usual to
place the date of Asclepiades somewhat later than
that which we have decided must be fixed for the
appearance of the New Comedy, but this later date
does not rest on any very strong evidence. Asclepiades
is mentioned along with Philetas in Theocritus
vii. 40, in a way which, at any rate, does not exclude
the possibility that he was a contemporary;<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Philetas,
as we know, was born in the reign of Philip,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> say,
338; Asclepiades may have been born several years
later, even in 330, and yet have had an influence on
Menander, for, as we know, he began his career as an
erotic poet at a very early age.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It is by no means
improbable that he may have visited Athens to
complete his education; his epigrams show an acquaintance
with Athenian comedy and life as there
described which could hardly have been acquired
elsewhere; such visits were paid to Athens by Callimachus,
Aratus, and others. It will, of course, be
urged that the influence may have been just the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
reverse, and that Menander suggested the romantic
idea to Asclepiades; but this is improbable for two
reasons. In the first place, Asclepiades is known to
have been a student of Antimachus,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> while Menander,
as far as we know, was not; in the second, though
Asclepiades shows, as has been said, evident traces
of the influence of comedy, such comedy is not New,
but distinctly Middle Comedy, as is sufficiently plain
from the drinking-scenes described in <i>Anth. Pal.</i>
v. 181, 185, from the frequent, or rather, constant
allusions to Hetaerae in his epigrams, and from the
complete absence from them of those particular
features of the romantic idea which Menander himself
developed. It is therefore well-nigh certain that,
if there was influence from either side,—and, when
one considers the close sympathy between the ideals
of the two writers, the conclusion that there was
some more than merely fortuitous affinity between
them is almost irresistible—such influence came from
the side of the brilliant young Samian, who would
thus deserve the credit of having originally inspired
not merely the romantic epigram, but also the
romantic drama.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> That this was actually so, no one
can of course affirm; but that it may have been,
no one who is familiar with the “wild-flowers of
Asclepiades” will be likely to deny.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THEOGNIS</i> (261 <i>seqq.</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The great difficulty in the way of a satisfactory
reconstruction of this passage lies in the fact
that it is not certain whether it is to be regarded
as simply a description of an erotic incident, or
whether it is a γρῖφος; in the latter and, perhaps,
more probable case, it is impossible to emend without
first finding the solution, and to guess a riddle
without knowing what that riddle is, rather requires
a Daniel or some similar commentator. It is not
quite so impossible, however, to improve the passage
if it is looked upon as merely descriptive of an actual
event, in which case the account of apparently similar
scenes in the Romance of Eumathius may, perhaps,
throw some light on the subject.</p>

<p>In the scene depicted in Theognis, the παῖς
τέρεινα is fenced off from her lover, not only by
an objectionable suitor, but also by the presence of
her severe “water-drinking” parents. Under these
circumstances, it does not seem very probable that
the lover would (as the ordinary reading makes him
do) throw his arms round her waist and kiss her
on the neck; such behaviour on his part (and its
natural consequences) might, it is true, account for
the abrupt termination of the poem, but still would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
not be, as I have said, exactly probable, especially
after he had been drinking only water. The scene
actually described was, perhaps, rather somewhat
of the following kind. When the time for drinking
was come, the girl in question got up and went
round, like the Hysmine of Eumathius, to hand the
cup to the guests,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> going, however, first to her
parents;<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> as these were only drinking ψυχρόν, her
office is contemptuously described as being that of
a water-carrier. The last two lines I would then read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἔνθα μέσην περὶ παῖδα λαβὼν ἀγκῶν’ ἐφίλησα,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>i.e.</i>, as she came on her round to her lover, he put
his arm on her waist and kissed her on the elbow;
and she, though she said nothing with her lips, “her
eyes were speaking.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Whether the actual words ought not to be still
further emended, is questionable; but, anyhow, the
general sense thus given is a little more complimentary
to Greek “company” manners.</p>

<p>The chief objection to this interpretation is, of
course, that it bestows on the epigram a decidedly
erotic character, which is not elsewhere to be found
in this book, and would certainly be an anachronism
if the lines belong to the fifth century.</p>

<p>The fragments of the <i>Phaedra</i> of Sophocles (among
which may be included Soph. <i>Fr.</i> 855, and Eur. <i>Fr.</i>
431, which both very possibly belong to this play)
are interesting for the many parallels they show
to the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (<i>Hom. Hymn.</i>
iv).</p>

<p>There, too, special emphasis is laid on the
universal sway of Aphrodite, not only over men
(l. 3), but also over animals (l. 4-6), and over Zeus
and the gods (l. 34 <i>seqq.</i>). The animals fawn on
her as she comes (l. 69, 70, cp. Soph. <i>Fr.</i> 625).
From l. 7 one might guess that Soph. <i>Fr.</i> 855, 13
was originally</p>

<p class="noindent">or something similar. Both l. 45 and Soph. <i>Fr.</i> 619
give Zeus as well as Aphrodite the power of inspiring
love; and other less important parallels could be
pointed out.</p>

<p>These parallels are very striking; and though one
must, of course, beware of drawing conclusions from
what may be merely accidental or external, it cannot
be denied that, if it could be proved that Sophocles
was working with this hymn in his mind and with
its conception of Aphrodite before him, this fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
alone would render it very unlikely that he would
treat his love-element in that “modern” way in
which it has hitherto been the fashion to assume
that he did.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it may not be inapposite to glance at
the love-incident which occurs in this Hymn, for,
if nothing else, it is interesting as a very typical
Greek “love-story.” What happens is briefly this:</p>

<p>Aphrodite, having fallen in love with Anchises,
disguises herself as a mortal maiden, and comes
upon the object of her affection as he is wandering
alone among the byres, singing to himself.</p>

<p>At first he takes her for a goddess, and is duly
humble; but she assures him that this is not the
case, but she is the daughter of the king of Phrygia,
and she asserts that she has been carried by Hermes
away from her home to be his (Anchises’) bride.
In her helpless condition, she, therefore, throws
herself on his mercy, and begs him by Zeus and
his parents:</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE ANDROMEDA OF EURIPIDES.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Of all the plays of Euripides, the one which is
generally looked upon as especially “romantic” is
the <i>Andromeda</i>,<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and it must be confessed that, at
first sight, it does appear to have a certain character
of its own. The common view of the story is, that
Perseus, seeing Andromeda exposed, falls in love
with her, and therefore rescues her. If this view is
correct, this play will furnish the solitary instance in
Euripides of a man’s falling in love with a woman.</p>

<p>But how far is this view correct? A careful
examination of the fragments will, perhaps, show
that it requires at least to be modified.</p>

<p>When the play opens, Andromeda is found exposed
on her rock, and after she has made due lamentations,
there appears Perseus, bearing evident marks
of his long journey, and generally in a deplorable
condition.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> On learning from her the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
case, he pities her, and, say the modern critics, falls in
love with her. I doubt it. This is not at all the sort
of occasion on which a Greek would be likely to fall
in love. Perseus is wet and dirty and hungry, and has
the prospect of a dangerous encounter before him.
Love, to the Greek, is essentially the child of ease and
idleness;<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> to connect it with stress and struggle is
entirely a modern notion. The one and only thing
which a Greek in Perseus’ position would be likely to
do, would be to try whether he couldn’t find someone—a
king by preference—to lend him some new
clothes;<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> and this, or something of the kind, is, in all
probability, what he makes the condition of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
saving Andromeda.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Then, cheered by the prospect
of a warm bath and of a comfortable night’s rest,
he goes to face the monster.</p>

<p>But though he does not fall in love with Andromeda,
<i>she falls in love with him</i>, and begs him, when
he returns victorious,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> to take her with him anywhere,
if only as a slave. She will follow him anywhere,
she says, even through the sky if he likes.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> In the
improved state of affairs,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Perseus is not averse to
these advances; but an obstacle arises in the shape
of Cepheus, who objects to the disreputable appearance
of his would-be son-in-law. Perseus argues his
case with considerable fervour, but apparently without
success; and it is Andromeda again who, by
some bold stroke, overcomes or outwits her parents,
and brings off what she wishes—οὐχ εἵλετο τῷ πατρὶ
συμμένειν οὐδὲ τῇ μητρί, ἀλλ’ αὐθαίρετος εἰς τὸ Ἄργος
ἀπῆλθε μετ’ ἐκείνου εὐγενές τι φρονήσασα.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>In other words, the initiative in the love-affair of
Perseus and Andromeda is again almost entirely on
the side of the woman, and this play forms in reality
no exception to the general rule in this respect.</p>

<p>While on the subject of the <i>Hippolytus</i>, I cannot
refrain from suggesting a couple of emendations in
the last scene of the play, which certainly improve
the present text artistically, and, perhaps, gain some
support from what we know of the two versions of
the work.</p>

<p>The first version ended with the promise of immortality
to Hippolytus as a reward for his constancy
(Eur. <i>Fr.</i> 446); in the second, this feature has entirely
disappeared, and the last words of the play are a
lament for the dead and a complaint of the injustice
of heaven. Indeed, it may be said that the injustice
of heaven is the chief moral of this second version.</p>

<p>Read therefore in l. 1415</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>And, once again, in l. 1440, when Artemis leaves
Hippolytus with the remark that she is very sorry, but
she doesn’t like death-bed scenes, he exclaims bitterly:</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE SECOND BOOK OF THEOGNIS.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The second book of Theognis consists almost entirely
of love-poems addressed to boys, and might
therefore be expected to furnish particularly valuable
evidence in the present connection, especially as
many of these poems are of a far more personal and
purely erotic character than those in the first book.
The date of this book is, however, disputed, and I
personally am inclined to believe that it is very much
later than the time of Theognis—too recent, in fact,
to belong to the period we are discussing at all. This
being so, I have naturally not chosen to lay stress
on its contents. For the sake of completeness,
however, I have added here a brief examination of
its character, for the benefit of anyone who may
believe in it.</p>

<p>The general tone of these poems, though noticeably
more passionate than that of the earlier collection,
is still chivalrous and dignified, and occasionally
rises to a very high level indeed. That spirit of self-negation,
which we have already observed to be
peculiar among the early Greeks to this form of love,
is in places very marked. Few passages in all classical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>

<p>Similarly, that fatherly attitude on the part of the

and in the Theocritean imitation of Alcaeus, is
apparent in more than one place (<i>e.g.</i> 1351 <i>seqq.</i>).

compare the lover to a horse’s owner or rider (1249

<p>Again, there is the same appeal to the friend’s better
feelings that we have noticed in Theocritus (1319

(1295 <i>seqq.</i>), all marked, too, by the same consideration
and courtesy (1235 <i>seqq.</i>); there is the same
exhortation to constancy, the same reproof of faithlessness
(1257 <i>seqq.</i>, &amp;c.), the same warning, full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
earnestness, but withal full of tenderness, as to the

has been said to show the general character of these

<p>The fragments of the Middle Comedy, belonging,
as they do, to the earlier and middle part of the
fourth century—that is, to the period of transition
between the two great epochs of Greek literature—might
have been expected to afford very valuable
evidence as to the development of the romantic
feeling. Unfortunately, however, this is not the
case; indeed, the information to be gathered from
them is, in this respect, of so little importance, that
it is hardly worth considering at all.</p>

<p>Various explanations suggest themselves to account
for this somewhat surprising fact. In the first
place, the remains of the Middle Comedy are very
small compared with the enormous original bulk of
this literature, and, besides this, nearly all the more
important fragments that we possess are derived
from Athenaeus, who generally quotes them with
a view to elucidating questions of cookery, or illustrating
the habits of fishmongers. But the real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
cause of the absence from these fragments of all
traces of a romantic element is probably a less
fortuitous one, and is to be found in the nature of
dramatic literature in general, and of comedy in
particular. A play, to be successful, must be behind
the times; if it treats its subjects in an enlightened
manner, it will be above the level of the mass of
its audience, and they will declare it dull, or ridiculous,
or both.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Dramatic authors know this well
enough, and, for the most part, carefully refrain
from insulting the spectators by telling them anything
new. The writers of the Middle Comedy
were no exception to this rule; and so, while their
plays dealt very extensively with women, and not
unfrequently, it would seem, with love-stories of a
sort, the treatment of these subjects was, out of
deference to their public, far more antiquated and
unsympathetic than one would have been inclined
to expect from writers who were often well acquainted
with the works of the most enlightened
thinkers of the time. Thus, therefore, strange as
it may at first sight appear, in all probability those
fragments which have survived furnish, on the whole,
a very good general idea of the relations between
men and women, as depicted in the Middle Comedy;
and there is in reality little reason to believe that,
even if we possessed a far larger quantity of this
literature, we should be able to learn much more
about this particular subject. The romantic element
is absent from these fragments because it was absent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
from the complete works to which they originally
belonged.</p>

<p>The main features of the Middle Comedy treatment
of erotic subjects (as illustrated by the fragments)
are very plain. There is nowhere any trace
of the romantic feeling; where “love” is praised or
recommended, as is, of course, not unfrequently the
case, what is understood thereby is always merely
sensual gratification. Plato and “Platonic” love are
stock subjects of ridicule. Marriage is invariably
alluded to in terms of contempt and dislike, and the
women introduced are almost always Hetaerae; but
even these are hardly ever spoken of with any respect
or affection, being generally described as vulgar,
drunken, and stingy, and in some cases attacked with
the most savage brutality. The effort which the
women at Athens were making about this time to
gain larger liberties, also comes in for its share of
ridicule; and altogether, these comedies show a want
of sympathy with every honourable ambition of the
age, which throws a strange light on that cultured
and artistic Athenian audience which one is generally
taught to admire.</p>

<p>I have before me an analysis<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> of all the passages
in which women are in any way referred to in this
literature; but, as I have already remarked, the
amount of information to be gained from them is
not sufficient to warrant a lengthy discussion. A
few specimens from the best-known writers will serve
to illustrate what has been said, and will give a
sufficiently clear idea of the nature of the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anaxandrides</span> is described by Suidas as having
been the first to introduce ἔρωτας καὶ παρθένων φθοράς,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
and is therefore important as forming a connecting-link
between Old and Middle Comedy; but there is
no important example of this peculiar feature in any
of the fragments of him that have survived, though
passages like that in the <i>Gerontomania</i> (<i>ap.</i> Athen.
xiii. 570 D), and titles of plays like <i>Anteron</i> or
<i>Kitharistria</i>, serve to give a very fair idea of the
nature of the “erotic element” thus introduced.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antiphanes</span> again, though making frequent

<p>Lastly, there is <span class="smcap">Alexis</span>, who, though he extends
from the Middle well into the New Comedy (388-284

former, and shows no signs of a newer spirit, unless
it be in the revolt against the artificiality of the
Hetaerae, of which there is a specimen in his <i>Isostasium</i>.

to “Platonic” love (<i>Helene</i>), though he does not
suggest the possibility of its application to women.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>

<p>The examination of these fragments has been very
barren of any but negative results, but this very
barrenness is not perhaps without a certain significance.
The Middle and the New Comedy kept the
stage at Athens (to the exclusion, in great part, of
original tragedy) without a check during the fourth
century; but at the same time, the continuity of the
dramatic tradition that pervades them is by no
means unbroken, and the differences between the
two styles of art are very marked. Of all these
differences, there is none more striking than that
in the treatment of the erotic element. This, which,
though introduced early enough into the Middle
Comedy, yet never attained to any real development
there, appears suddenly in the New Comedy as a
feature of overwhelming importance. Nor is this
all. The erotic element, which, from henceforward,
occupies so prominent a place in comedy, differs in
character <i>toto caelo</i> from that which occurs in the
earlier dramas. Instead of the ἑταίρα, the New
Comedy introduces us to the παρθένος; instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
marriage being the stock subject of ridicule, it
becomes the hero’s ideal.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>This change of attitude is so marked, that it seems
impossible to regard the later feeling as a development
of the earlier; the revolution is so violent, that
it seems inevitable to admit that it came in some
manner from without. And, as a matter of fact, if
we consider the period from which the New Comedy
dates, it is by no means difficult to conjecture what
the source of this external influence may have
been.</p>

<p>Menander brought out his first play, at a very
early age, in 322; about this time, Asclepiades and
Philetas were already coming into prominence; those
influences which induced the Coan school to speak of
women in a manner so different from that of previous
writers, may well have impressed the Athenian also,
and produced a body of poets who, though differing
in certain important points from the “Alexandrians,”
were yet distinctly romantic.</p>

<p>To this subject of the romantic element in the
New Comedy, I hope at some future time to be able
to return,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> so that I will not speak of it further here,
except so far as to point out that, firstly (an obvious
fact, but one that seems sometimes strangely ignored),
the New Comedy is distinctly later in date than the
Coan school of poets, and cannot therefore, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
any circumstances, claim priority for the introduction
of the romantic element into literature; while
secondly, if the introduction of this element was
really due, as is commonly asserted, to the influence
of Euripides, it seems strange that, while so many of
his views were common property at Athens from the
very beginning of the fourth century, not one of the
Athenian playwrights, some of whom studied him so
thoroughly, should have felt this particular influence
till nearly a century after his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<div class="hanging">

wine during dinner.</p>

<p>Graphe. The story of the man who fell in love with
the statue at Samos. (It would be obvious to
suggest that in this play a man is introduced
who falls in love with a picture. More probably,
however, this passage comes from the speech of
some painter who is extolling his art, possibly to
some lady, in the way Ovid used to do. Cp.
<i>Ars Amat.</i> iii. 397 <i>seqq.</i>, 533 <i>seqq.</i>, etc.)</p>

<p>Lyciscus 1. A mention of the Hetaera Pythionice.</p>

<p>Mandragorizomene 5. A lover visits his sick lady.
The whole play seems to have turned on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
subject of this kind (cp. Fr. 2), and calls to mind
pictures like that in Ovid, <i>Ars Amat.</i> ii. 319 <i>seqq.</i>,

<p>Manteis. The slavery of marriage.</p>

<h3>AMPHIS.</h3>

<p>Several plays satirising women, such as the <i>Acco</i>*
(the silly woman), the Gynaecocratia and the Gynaecomania.</p>

<p>The Scholiast of Germanicus’ <i>Aratea</i> quotes the
legends of Zeus and Callisto (p. 38), and of the Dog
Star and Opora (p. 76) from Amphis; these legends
seem to have occurred in plays now lost.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Of the Sappho no important fragment is preserved.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Amphicrates. A confidential slave arguing with his
young master on the folly of the latter’s attachment
to a certain lady.</p>

<p>Athamas. The inevitable superiority of the Hetaera
over the wife.</p>

<p>Curis 1, 2. An Hetaera who deserves to be rich,
more than Sinope and the others who are.</p>

<p>Dithyrambus 2. Ridicule of “Platonic” love.</p>

<p>Gynaecocratia. The liberated husband. (It is easy
to imagine how the outraged wife breaks in
upon this happy party, something after the
manner of Cynthia in Prop. iv. 8.)</p>

<p>Gynaecomania. Seems to suggest a similar scene, if
indeed, the two plays be not one and the same.</p>

<p>Ialemus 1. An invective against lettuces.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<h3>ARAROS.</h3>

<p>The Adonis and the Caeneus dealt with erotic
legends, as is plain from Fr. 1 of the former and
Fr. 4 of the latter. The same is perhaps true of the
Panos Gonae (Fr. 2.) The Hymenaeus contained a
description of a wedding (Fr. 2), and the <i>Parthenidion</i>*
may also have dealt with erotic subjects.</p>

<h3>NICOSTRATUS.</h3>

<p>The Pandrosus introduces (Fr. 2, 3) an elderly
gentleman supping with a lady, among whose acquaintances
is numbered Ocimum (Fr. 1).</p>

<p><i>Incert.</i> 9 describes a prude.</p>

<p>Besides these, the titles <i>Anterosa</i>, Habra, and the
corrupt <i>Otis</i>,* seem to suggest erotic subjects.</p>

<h3>PHILETAERUS.</h3>

<p>In the Atalanta, the fragment which it is usual to
assign to a parasite might perhaps be assigned to
the heroine of the piece, who would thus appear in
her legendary character of the “advanced woman,”,
something like the lady in Juvenal vi. 246 <i>seqq.</i>, 425
<i>seqq.</i></p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Corinthiastes. The superiority of Hetaerae to

<div class="hanging">

Hetaera, of course,) coaxing away

Empole 2. The same (?) urging on a disorderly
member of the party the advantages
of harmony.</p>

having a drink all round.</p>

<p>Philyra (named after the Hetaera) 2. The heroine (?)
coaxing an elderly gentleman to commit what
he considers an extravagance. (Fr. 3 seems to
suggest that a younger lover appeared on the
scene and expressed himself as jealous.)</p>

<p>Sappho. How to recognise a πόρνος.</p>

</div>

<h3>ANAXILAS.</h3>

<div class="hanging">

<p class="center"><i>THE QUESTION OF WOMEN’S RIGHTS IN THE
MIDDLE COMEDY.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It is usual to assume that there was, during the earlier
part of the fourth century, a strong agitation at Athens
in favour of “women’s rights.” The social status
of the Theban, as well as of the Lacedaemonian,
women, had been brought, owing to political events,
under the notice of even the most consistent
Athenian, and advantage is supposed to have been
taken of this fact by the advocates of female liberty
at Athens, to endeavour to obtain for the women
there some of those privileges which notoriously
belonged to their neighbours. This being so, it will
be interesting to consider in how far, if at all, this
movement is reflected in the literature of the period.</p>

<p>The general treatment of women in the Middle
Comedy being such as it is, there would be every
reason to expect to find plays in which these efforts
of women to obtain more general recognition from
men, would be made the subject of more or less
contemptuous ridicule. The fashion started by
Aristophanes in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> must have been, one
would have thought, too fascinating to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The fact, however, remains that, in such portions
of the Middle Comedy as still exist, there is practically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
no trace of anything of the kind. There are,
it is true, one or two titles of plays which seem
at first sight suggestive, but further investigation
generally reveals little. Thus the <i>Gynaecocratia</i>
and the <i>Gynaecomania</i> of Amphis both seem aimed,
not at the tyranny of women in general, but at the
tyranny of wives.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>As for the <i>Gynaecocratia</i> of Alexis, all that can
be gathered from the fragments is that it seems
to have had certain features in common with the
<i>Scenas Catalambanusae</i> of Aristophanes; as to its
tone or tendency, there is no clue in the two short
passages that remain.</p>

<p>The suggestion made above (<a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>) as to the
meaning of the fragment of the <i>Atalanta</i> of
Philetaerus is, of course, purely conjectural, and
cannot, therefore, bear evidence either way.</p>

<p>And that is all. This almost entire absence from
the Middle Comedy of plays dealing with the
question of “women’s rights,” would seem to justify
a certain hesitation in accepting the common view
that this question was at the time a burning one.
So general a silence on the point, in a literature
which deals exhaustively with every other phase
of contemporary life, seems not unreasonably to
suggest that the extent and influence of the movement
have been exaggerated, and that, as far as it
existed at all, it was confined to a small body of
enthusiasts, and was well-nigh without effect on the
body of the nation at large.</p>

<p class="center"><i>SOME FURTHER NOTES ON FAMILY RELATIONS
AS TREATED IN MIDDLE AND NEW COMEDY.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Though it has nothing to do with our immediate
subject, it may be interesting to notice briefly the
attitude of the New Comedy towards that description
of family problems which the <i>Canace</i> of
Euripides and similar works had made popular
among certain classes of art-lovers. That such works
had ever any great hold over the public at large is
neither proved nor probable.</p>

<p>In the first place, we may notice the unpleasant
accident by which, in the <i>Curculio</i>, the soldier is
made unconsciously to buy his sister as his mistress.
Here, however (Plaut. <i>Curc.</i> v. 2, 55 <i>seqq.</i>), as soon
as the recognition takes place, Planesium is at once
given in marriage by her brother to her lover—as
soon, that is to say, as her consent has been obtained
to this course (<i>ibid.</i> 73). In the Middle Comedy
<i>Epidicus</i>, where a similar incident occurs, the
behaviour of Stratippocles is somewhat less correct
(Plaut. <i>Epid.</i> v. 1, 42 <i>seqq.</i>), though here, too, the
side of propriety is at once championed by the slave,
and prevails without any real delay. That incidents
of this kind were not uncommon in New Comedy
seems probable from the nature of that class of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
drama, but there is no reason to suppose that they
ever had any other conclusion than that which occurs
in the cases quoted above. Cases of rivalry between
father and son, such as occur in the <i>Casina</i> and the
<i>Mercator</i>, belong to a class of drama which has
nothing to do with romantic New Comedy. The
<i>dénouements</i> of the <i>Asinaria</i> and the <i>Bacchides</i>, which
are so little sympathetic to modern ideas, are both to
some extent apologised for by their authors,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and
also, as will be observed, occur in plays which have
Hetaerae for their heroines.</p>

<p>A certain lack of regard for decency on the part
of the father in the son’s presence, and <i>vice versâ</i>,
(which is rather startling to the modern reader in
such passages as Plaut. <i>Asin.</i> v. 2, 30 <i>seqq.</i>, Ter.
<i>Heaut. Timor.</i> iii. 3, 1, and elsewhere,) is probably
most simply explained by <i>autres temps autres moeurs</i>.
Altogether, it would seem that the privacy which is
to modern ideas somewhat of an essential in these
matters, was at a considerable discount at this period
of society. Cp. Plaut. <i>Bacch.</i> iii. 3, 73 <i>seqq.</i>, <i>Curc.</i> i.
3, 16 <i>seqq.</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, attention may be called to Hanno’s rather
remarkable method of searching for his lost daughters.
(Plaut. <i>Poen.</i> prolog. 106 <i>seqq.</i>). Whether this is intended
for a realistic study of Semitic habits, can be
left to others to decide.</p>

“romance,” like “chivalry,” embodies the old superstition that such

is little real risk of misunderstanding, and I cannot think of anything

have just the contrary effect.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> That this was the general character of the erotic legends introduced
into the celebrated “Catalogus” ascribed to Hesiod, seems shown by
the remark in Serv. <i>ad. Aen.</i> vii. 268: “Hesiodus etiam περὶ των

cp. the whole note.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The parallel view, that if a man wished to really love anyone, the
only worthy object he could find would be another man, was doubtless,
in part, the result of a similar line of argument, though its true origin
must of course be sought in something more inspiring than mere
contempt for women. A further examination of this side of the
question will be made later on.</p>

no one, of course, would wish to deny that the sexual instinct, in its

love-poetry; but the sexual instinct can never of itself
supply the fundamental basis of the feeling necessary for the production
of such poetry. Woman, regarded <i>merely</i> as a source of pleasure or

Cp. Archil. <i>Fr.</i> 142, 184; Hippon. <i>Fr.</i> 110, 111. In curious contrast to
what may be called the ‘wife-poetry’ of the early Greeks is the pretty
picture in Hesiod (<i>Op.</i> 517, <i>seqq.</i>) of the unmarried girl, sitting at
home, in every sense of the words κακῶν ἄπειρος. But strangest of all

that Glaucus was the object of Archilochus’ affection as that he was the
object of his scorn. To see in him a prototype of the Egnatius of
Catullus, as, for instance, Lafaye does (<i>Catulle et ses Modèles</i>, p. 29),
is quite unwarranted by any evidence; for the epithet κεροπλάστης of
<i>Fr.</i> 57 is not necessarily derogatory, while the tone of such passages as
<i>Fr.</i> 54, 70, is certainly not that of invective.</p>

and there is certainly no reason to suppose that it was addressed
to the woman in question. The difference between describing such an
emotion generally, and describing it as one’s own, to the person who
causes it, need hardly be dwelt upon.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> To endeavour, as some have done, to reconstruct the satires of
Archilochus from those of Catullus, is simply labour thrown away,
because between the periods in which the two poets lived, the whole
way of regarding women had been revolutionised, and ideas which
seemed obvious to the Latin writer would have been unintelligible to
the Greek. To Catullus thwarted love was an agony; to Archilochus
it was an insult, and no man of his time would, or could, have regarded
it otherwise. Thus, to suppose, as Lafaye (<i>op. cit.</i> l.c.) does, that the
satires of Archilochus were interspersed with erotic passages, like Catull.
xxxix. (a poem he considers to be imitated from Archilochus), is to
suppose an anachronism.</p>

these, probably early, poems, are 29 and 94. Besides this, the mention
of Tantalus (87, to which belongs 100) may well have been introduced
by the story of Ganymede; that of Niobe’s children (109) by the story
of those loves of theirs of which Sophocles afterwards wrote. The
expression ἐν Θεσσαλίῳ κλείτει (85) might well in such a poem have
had reference to Apollo and Admetus, whose love is held up as a
model, like that of the lovers in Theocritus xii. But most striking
of all, perhaps, to the modern reader, is the feeling that prompts
Alcman to speak of the Spartan girls as his “female boy-friends.”

lines on Agido, or the ὑποκορισμός with which his maidens speak, or
his confessions of how he likes his dinner served. One can think of
those Spartan girls laughing at their old Lydian dancing-master, as they
ran away down to the “baths of Eurotas,” while he went slowly home

<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[59]</a> There is really no adequate reason for disbelieving the story in
Ptol. Hephaest. iv. (Gale, <i>Hist. poet. script. ant.</i> p. 320; cf. Bergk. <i>ad
Stesich.</i> <i>Fr.</i> 26.) What that story seems to imply is that Helen of
Himera deserted the poet, who was thereby induced to moralise on the
innate faithlessness of Helens in general. A subsequent reconciliation
with the lady in question then led to the celebrated apology. The
greater influence which women seem to have had over old men than
over young, will already have been noticed in the cases of Alcman and
Anacreon. The phenomenon could easily be explained, if it were
necessary to explain it.—Vide <i>e.g.</i> Eur. <i>Suppl.</i> 1098 <i>seqq.</i></p>

love, and dies sooner than submit, has been shown by Reitzenstein,
<i>Epig. u. Skol.</i> p. 193 <i>seqq.</i></p>

<p>But the passage from Aelian (<i>Var. Hist.</i> x. 18) never says that Stesichorus
told the story of Daphnis. It says he wrote bucolic poetry,
which is not necessarily the same thing. If only Theocritus, who wrote
bucolic poetry, had told some more of the story of Daphnis, the necessity
of reading a great quantity of literature on the subject would have
been spared us.</p>

the relations between Hippolytus and Theseus, and in their argument,
where both start from the assumption that it would be absurd to
suppose that the former could possibly have been in love with Phaedra.
Of the lost plays it is hard to speak with confidence, but certainly the
<i>Andromeda</i>, <i>Phoenix</i>, and <i>Aeolus</i>, seem to have been the only three
in which the love element was at all the leading motive. The heroine
of the <i>Meleager</i> was probably Althaea, not Atalanta. The <i>Stheneboea</i>
merely describes the vengeance of Bellerophon for the treachery of his
hosts. In the <i>Antigone</i> the “love-story” has all taken place before

how far he has modified it, cannot now be known; but it seems
reasonable to suppose that, in all probability, the Clytemnestra of
the latter poet was a good deal more in love with Aegisthus than is
the Clytemnestra of the former. This would explain some incongruities
in the Aeschylean character, such as her sudden protestations
of affection for Aegisthus when dead, after her apparent indifference
to him when living. (<i>Cho.</i> 893, etc.) That she should kill Agamemnon
out of revenge for the death of Iphigeneia and through jealousy of
Cassandra, are perhaps additions of Aeschylus, to whose Athenian
mind it seemed impossible that a woman should murder her husband
merely because she was fond of another man.</p>

<i>And.</i> 222, and numerous similar passages); but even if this be
granted, it makes no difference to the point at all. Whatever the
audience are to think, the characters on the stage are supposed to
take her seriously; and this fact throws a sufficient light on what
was then thought to be the duty of a loving wife.</p>

Sophocles there.</p>

particular trait should have had influence on anyone so Athenian as
Sophocles. Anyhow, these two passages prove nothing.</p>

δ’ ἔχων μέμηνεν, “the stricken one is mad,” as the Romans said

property (ὃς ἐν κτήμασι, πίπτεις). Like Eresichthon’s father, what the

however, perhaps owing merely to the chance which has preserved
certain plays while others have been lost, it plays a particularly important
part. Not only are the <i>Antigone</i> and the <i>Electra</i> almost
entirely devoted to it, but the one ray of light in the 1800 lines of the

<p><a id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="label">[96]</a> The difference is described with wonderful force by Maximus
Tyrius (xxv. 4): ὁ μὲν ἐφ’ ἡδονὴν οἰστρεῖ, ὁ δὲ κάλλους ἐρᾶ· ὁ μὲν ἄκων
νοσεῖ, ὁ δὲ ἑκὼν ἐρᾷ· ὁ μὲν ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ ἐρᾷ τοῦ ἐρωμένου, ὁ δὲ ἐπ’ ὀλέθρῳ
ἀμφοῖν.—I have spoken here merely of women because we have so
little absolute evidence as to men, but what little we have all goes to
prove that their view of “love” was at least as sensual as that of the
women, and if anything even more brutal; and, anyhow, there is no
evidence of the contrary. It is very hard satisfactorily to compare
Euripides with people like Asclepiades, who are the earliest representatives
we know of the modern spirit, for this very reason, that while
the former nearly always discusses the matter from the point of view of
the woman, the latter do so with almost equal regularity, as far as we
can now judge, from the point of view of the man. One thing, however,
is clear enough at the very outset. While Euripides regards the
relation between man and woman as entirely based on the sexual
instinct, the Alexandrians have from the first imported into it that
further feeling of comradeship and mutual self-sacrifice which had
before been peculiar to the relation between man and man. For
obvious reasons this great change first became noticeable on the side
of the man (for the influence of Sappho’s school had probably by this
time become inappreciable), but its effects are evident enough as soon
as the Alexandrians begin to talk of a woman’s love. The difference
between, say, the Medea of Apollonius and the most refined heroine
of the Attic drama is one, not of degree, but of kind.</p>

furnished as splendid a conflict of emotions as any dramatist could
desire. Athenian taste, however, preferred that she should die congratulating
him on having had such a wife, while he stands by expressing
his deep regret that he cannot accompany her, as Charon does not

than a person of more human passions, and that this strange
disproportion in his speech is a mark of his character. Personally
I doubt this, as, firstly, the characters of the Athenian drama,
when making their set speeches, generally quite forget who they are—indeed,
the wonder is they don’t sometimes slip into an ἄνδρες
δικασταί—and, secondly, if Hippolytus had been meant to slur over
an important part of his subject, his reasons for so doing would have
been more definitely explained. The conclusion seems to me inevitable,
that neither Hippolytus nor Theseus thought the possibility
of the former’s having been in love with Phaedra worthy of serious
discussion.</p>

little sympathy. The best (in the extant odes) is that of Pelops and
Hippodameia (<i>Olymp.</i> 1), where the writer has, perhaps, been roused
to a little warmth by the story of Pelops and Poseidon that has immediately
preceded. The legend of Peleus and Hippolyte (<i>Nem.</i> 5) is
noticeable as being, strangely enough, the only one in which the woman
is represented as taking the initiative; but this is doubtless to be explained
by the fact that nearly all these stories are descriptive of the
amours of <i>gods</i>. The story of Jason and Medea is utterly spoiled in
<i>Pyth.</i> 4. In that of Apollo and Coronis (<i>Pyth.</i> 3) only the unfaithfulness
of the nymph and her punishment are dwelt upon. The other
erotic stories told—<i>i.e.</i> those of Apollo and Euadne (<i>Olymp.</i> 6), Apollo
and Cyrene (<i>Pyth.</i> 9), Zeus and the daughter of Opoeis (<i>Olymp.</i> 9),
Ixion and Hera (<i>Pyth.</i> 2), are merely concerned with seductions of the
most commonplace kind. The story of Rhoecus and the Hamadryad
(<i>Fr.</i> 165) is the only one of importance alluded to in the fragments;

It is usual to assume that the Battis of Philetas was an Hetaera; but
the evidence seems rather to suggest that she was his wife. The way
in which she is spoken of in Ovid, <i>Trist.</i> i. 6, 2, <i>Pont.</i> iii. 1, 57, (in
the former place coupled with the Lyde of Antimachus,) seems to
support this view; and, at any rate, there does not appear to be any
evidence to the contrary. The personal character of Philetas, as we
learn it from various notices of him, seems also rather to point in the
same direction; though this is not, of course, an argument that can be
pressed. (It would be interesting to know whether the fact that
Philetas is apparently never alluded to under a nickname, like so many
others of the Alexandrian writers, was due to this austerity of character.)</p>

<p>Whether these elegies were as sober and as little sensual in tone as
those of Antimachus (cp. <i>infra</i>, <a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>), it is impossible now to say;
though the two passages cited from Ovid both seem indirectly to imply
that they were, and there is certainly nothing in the fragments of
Philetas which would lead one to infer that they were not. It need
hardly be added that the passage in Ovid, <i>Ars Amat.</i> iii. 329 <i>seqq.</i>
proves nothing, for the “lascivia” there ascribed to Sappho is obviously
not meant to apply to all the other poets mentioned in the list, or
Vergil’s name would hardly appear in it.</p>

The nature of this general attack on the philosophers must not be
misunderstood. It is an error to suppose that the more old-fashioned
among the Athenians disapproved, in the first instance, of the
philosophers because they were paederasts; it would be truer to say
that they turned against paederasty because it was so intimately

shown by the fact that Aeschylus of all people treated it in this way
in his <i>Myrmidones</i>. That the attachment was further regarded as a
perfectly pure one might be equally proved from the fragments of that
tragedy, if indeed proof were necessary. Insinuations like those
elaborated at the end of Lucian’s <i>Amores</i> are a much later aftergrowth.</p>

to show that it must have been of a certain antiquity, and anyhow
was not a pure invention on the part of Euripides. The evidence
of Aelian (<i>N. H.</i> vi. 15), though of little value, is to the same effect:

<p><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> It may not be out of place to emphasise here once more the
difference that exists between regarding women as an object of interest
or importance, and regarding them as an object of love; for the two
have been confused by many, not only in estimating the influence
of Euripides (cp. <i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_40">40, 50</a>), but also in considering the events
of the earlier part of the fourth century. Thus many have pointed to
the agitation in favour of “women’s rights” satirised in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>,
or to the great social importance of the Hetaerae (as illustrated
in the Middle Comedy, &amp;c.), or to the generally ameliorated
condition of women of every class, as proofs of the existence at this
period already of the romantic feeling. But to those who care to
consider the matter clearly, it must be apparent that all these things
are really beside the question. The improved state of women and
their increasing power may have helped, and doubtless did help, to
spread the romantic feeling when once it had originated; but they
were in the first instance entirely independent of it. One does not
<i>ipso facto</i> feel a romantic attachment for people because one is
compelled to recognise them socially, while in these days of extended
franchises it is surely not necessary to repeat that political recognition
is not the same as love.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_194" href="#FNanchor_194" class="label">[194]</a> This respect for marriage (if one extends the idea of marriage
sufficiently to cover every form of union which is faithfully observed—whether
actually legalised by some particular ceremony or not, is,
in this connection, not very material) will, I think, be found underlying
the whole Greek conception of romance. This is, of course, diametrically
opposed to the view of the mediaeval barbarians, who held that
the one woman in the world one could not love was one’s wife.
Whether Lyde or Isolde be the higher ideal is, perhaps, a matter
of taste; <i>magno se iudice quaeque tuetur</i>. That I personally prefer
the Greek to the barbarian is perhaps due to prejudice, but it is
prejudice for which I am very grateful.</p>

<p>A further illustration may be found in the Latin elegiac poets. Propertius,
the “Roman Callimachus,” who is always calling attention to
the Greek sources of his inspiration, addresses all his love-poems to
the Hetaera Cynthia, to whom he remained faithful to the end. Ovid
only invokes the Greeks (Antimachus in <i>Trist.</i> i. 6, 1; Philetas in
<i>Trist.</i> i. 6, 2, <i>Pont.</i> iii. 1, 58) when addressing his wife. Tibullus and
Catullus, the poets of adultery, never acknowledge in their love-poems
their Greek predecessors, and Catullus even goes out of his
way to abuse one of them.</p>

in Plat. Tim.</i> i. p. 28.</p>

<p>Whether these anecdotes are actually true or not does not much
matter. That the friendship between Antimachus and Plato was a well-known
fact would be sufficiently proved by their invention; but there is
nothing really contradictory or improbable in them, as some have
asserted. In the story from Plutarch there is no need to suppose that
Plato was actually present at Samos; he may very well have met
Antimachus afterwards elsewhere. The evidence of Proclus again
merely says that Plato, in opposition to the prevailing opinion of
his time, preferred Antimachus to Choerilus, and that he sent Heracleides
to Colophon to make a collection of the works of the former,
evidently after his death. It is consequently quite possible to reconcile
all three narratives. Antimachus was defeated by Niceratus at the
Lysandria, an event which, owing to his celebrity at the time (404 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
naturally excited remark. Subsequently he met Plato, who, when the
conversation turned on his defeat, complimented him in the way described—a
compliment which Antimachus returned on another occasion
(that alluded to by Cicero). Lastly, after Antimachus’ death, Plato
caused a collection of his works to be made. Where Plato met
Antimachus is not quite clear, but the ascription to the former of the
epigram in Athen. xiii. 589 C (<i>Anth. Pal.</i> vii. 217) would almost seem
to imply that there was, at any rate, a tradition that Plato visited
Colophon. If that was actually the case, he would naturally have
come across Antimachus there.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_204" href="#FNanchor_204" class="label">[204]</a> It may be remarked in passing that this ideal character of the
“New” Comedy is not, as a rule, sufficiently recognised. People
speak as if they thought that the stories in Menander, for instance,
represented the ordinary events of life at Athens at the end of the
fourth century. It need hardly, perhaps, be remarked that it would
be about as reasonable to endeavour to get an idea of the ordinary life
of English people at the present day by studying an Adelphi melodrama.
As long as comedy at Athens confined itself to social satire, it
is obvious that the social scenes it depicted must have been, even if
somewhat burlesqued, yet, on the whole, true to life. When once it
had abandoned this object, and began to aim at telling an exciting
story, calculated to interest its audience in proportion to the strangeness
and novelty of its <i>dénouement</i>, it is equally obvious that it must
very soon have been compelled to abandon the ordinary affairs of
everyday life. In taking over the business of the Epic, Comedy took
with it the license of that form of composition and of its offspring,
Tragedy. While no one will deny that incidents like those described
by Menander may have occasionally taken place at Athens in the
fourth century, just as some of them might conceivably take place in
England at the present day, there can be hardly any real doubt that
the stories of romantic comedy were as little true to the ordinary life of
the time they professed to depict, as, say, the novel of Xenophon was to
the ordinary life of the Roman provinces under the Antonines.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_205" href="#FNanchor_205" class="label">[205]</a> It is true, of course, that the “New” Comedy took over from its
predecessor certain characters (<i>e.g.</i> the parasite or the cook) and certain
other features, practically unchanged; but all this was confined to minor
points of detail, and any similarity between the two forms of art which
such transference of ready-made <i>specialités</i> may cause is a purely superficial
one. The main subject of romantic comedy, and the treatment
there of that main subject, are entirely distinct from everything that
had gone before.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_206" href="#FNanchor_206" class="label">[206]</a> Thus the Megarian Comedy dates from the expulsion of Theagenes
(Arist. <i>Poet.</i> iii. 5), while the Athenian reappears, after a silence of
some 70 years, on the expulsion of Hippias.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_207" href="#FNanchor_207" class="label">[207]</a> The titles of the plays attributed to Chionides do not in themselves
contradict this view. The <i>Heroes</i> describes life as it would be in a
state engaged in war, but there is no reason to believe that the play
discussed any real phase of any contemporary war. The <i>Persae</i>, too,
to judge by its second title of <i>Assyrii</i>, was devoted rather to ridiculing
Persian customs than to dealing with the Persian War. In like manner
the <i>Lydi</i> of Magnes introduced the Lydian dances to Athens (cp.
Hesych. λυδίζων, χορεύων, διὰ τοὺς Αυδούς <i>sc.</i> Μάγνητος), while the
<i>Barbatistae</i> appears to have been equally aimed at the aesthetic tastes
of some part of the community. Titles again, like <i>Ornithes</i>, <i>Batrachi</i>,
and <i>Psenes</i>, give no suggestion of political motives, any more than does
the <i>Satyri</i> of Ecphantides.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_210" href="#FNanchor_210" class="label">[210]</a> It is further to be observed that, though Cratinus nearly always
indulges in personal abuse, this abuse is by no means necessarily
directed against <i>political</i> characters. Any person, whatever his
capacity, who was sufficiently well known to be recognised by the
Athenian audience, was liable to be the butt of his scurrility.</p>

expresses it: “Cratetem primum apud Athenienses exstitisse qui
Epicharmi exemplo comicae poeseos materiam a singulorum hominum
irrisione ad generales morum notationes rerumque descriptiones traduceret.”
Crates thus differs from Cratinus in that his plays were not
political, while he differs from the earlier comedians in that he avoided
personalities and treated of general subjects, and this is the meaning of
the word πρῶτος in Aristotle, <i>l.c.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213" class="label">[213]</a> The law of Morychis, during the operation of which this play,
like the <i>Odysses</i> of Cratinus and various others, seems to have been
brought out, is interesting as an early instance of the influence of
political events upon the development of early Athenian comedy, an
influence entirely absent in the case of the romantic comedy.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_214" href="#FNanchor_214" class="label">[214]</a> Thus the final disappearance of the <i>parabasis</i>, though an important
enough event for the history of the form of Comedy, is but
an incident in the real development of the art. This is shown by
the fact that, when, under the law of Morychis, the <i>parabasis</i> was
temporarily suspended, the result was the immediate appearance,
at this date already, of plays which belong, in spirit, entirely to
“Middle” Comedy.</p>

place some time after the erotic incident had been closed, while in the
<i>Seriphii</i> the description of Andromeda as δελέαστρα (<i>Fr.</i> 12) is the only
allusion to her preserved. Indeed, it is vain in Cratinus to look for any
leading motive at all, for, as Platonius says of him (<i>de Com.</i> p. 27),
εὔστοχος ὢν ἐν ταῖς ἐπιβολαῖς τῶν δραμάτων καὶ διασκευαῖς, εἶτα προϊὼν

citizen seems to have been legally bound to marry her, and therefore,
to a certain extent, there was no great virtue in his action if
he did so, at the same time this legal necessity was never, so far as
we know, in any way urged in any play of the New Comedy. The
point will be more fully discussed when we come to this part of our

auxilium petiit. illae Minoem occiderunt. Hygin. <i>Fab.</i> 44.</p>

τοῦ θανάτου διότι κατὰ τὸν λουτρῶνα ὠλίσθηκε καὶ πεσὼν εἰς τὸ θερμὸν
ὕδωρ ἐτελεύτησε. (Diodorus, iv. 79.)</p>

<p>The story is told somewhat differently in Zenobius iv. 92. There
Minos, in order to discover Daedalus, goes about the world offering
large rewards to anyone who can run a linen thread through a spiral
shell, being convinced that no one but Daedalus would be able to
do such a thing. When he comes to Sicily, Cocalus, in order to gain
the reward, gives the shell to Daedalus, who bores a hole at the end,
ties the linen thread to an ant, and so does what is required. λαβὼν
δὲ ὁ Μίνως τὸν λίνον διειρμένον ᾔσθετο εἶναι παρ’ ἐκείνῳ τὸν Δαίδαλον
καὶ εὐθέως ἀπῄτει. Κώκαλος δὲ, ὑποσχόμενος δώσειν, ἐξένισεν αὐτόν.
ὁ δὲ λουόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν Κωκάλου θυγατέρων ἀνῃρέθη ζέουσαν πίσσαν
ἐπιχεαμένων αὐτῷ.—This is the version of the story followed by
Sophocles in the <i>Camici</i>. (Cp. <i>Fr.</i> 301, 302.)</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that Daedalus, according to Diodorus, iv. 78,
made a cave at Selinus, in which patients were treated by being subjected
to a gradually-increasing temperature. (τρίτον δὲ σπήλαιον κατὰ
τὴν Σελινουντίαν χώραν κατεσκεύασεν, ἐν ᾧ τὴν ἀτμίδα τοῦ κατ’ αὐτὴν
πυρὸς οὕτως εὐστόχως ἐξέλαβεν ὥστε διὰ τὴν μαλακότητα τῆς θερμασίας
ἐξιδροῦν λεληθότως, καὶ κατὰ μικρὸν τοὺς ἐνδιατρίβοντας μετὰ τέρψεως
θεραπεύειν τὰ σώματα, μηδὲν παρενοχλουμένους ὑπὸ τῆς θερμότητος.) It
is, perhaps, not impossible that Aristophanes may have described
Minos’ death as occurring in this cave.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_235" href="#FNanchor_235" class="label">[235]</a> By the word “plot” as here used, must of course be understood
merely the erotic incident. That the action was not confined to one
subject of this kind is obvious to every reader of Aristophanes.
Whatever may have been the treatment of the erotic element, there
can be practically no doubt that this element was only one, perhaps
not the most important one, among the many that went to make
up the play.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_236" href="#FNanchor_236" class="label">[236]</a> <i>Fr.</i> 4 seems to suggest that there may have been a regular trial
instituted, as in the <i>Vespae</i> (cp. <i>Vesp.</i> 807 <i>seqq.</i> with <i>Cocal.</i> <i>Fr.</i> 12),
at which Daedalus was accused of complicity in the murder, and his
services to Cocalus as a builder (<i>Fr.</i> 5; cp. Diodorus, iv. 78) urged on
his behalf. This trial may well have had features in common with the
last scene in Euripides’ <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_237" href="#FNanchor_237" class="label">[237]</a> The fact that this play led to the abandonment of certain nocturnal
orgies is, of course, no proof that such habits altogether ceased, even
for a time; indeed, it is notorious that they did not.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_238" href="#FNanchor_238" class="label">[238]</a> Even if it could be proved that the play ended with a wedding—such
endings are, as we have seen, not uncommon in Aristophanes—and
that this is what the grammarian means by his τἄλλα πάντα ἃ
ἐζήλωσε Μένανδρος, this would not, in itself, be enough to make the
play a romantic one after the manner of the later works. The
marriage would have to be <i>an act of reparation inspired by love</i>, and
it need hardly be remarked how utterly foreign any such feeling would
be to the work of Aristophanes. Such a difference in spirit and
motive, however, important and obvious as it seems to us, may very
well have escaped the ancient critics, whose criticism of art was well-nigh
exclusively concerned with its external and superficial qualities.
Hence, if by any chance Aristophanes’ characters were despatched
off the stage to the sounds of a wedding march, it is easy to see how
clear a proof this would have seemed to them that the <i>Cocalus</i> belonged
to the same phase of art as the plays of Menander, when,
in reality, it did nothing of the kind.</p>

married immediately—a fact which induces the intruder to exclaim:</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_249" href="#FNanchor_249" class="label">[249]</a> Great care must be taken not to misunderstand the causes of this
prominence of the Hetaera in Middle Comedy. The fall of Athens,
and the events immediately preceding it, resulted in a revolution of the
Athenian social system, which was even more momentous than the
political overthrow. From this time onwards, the individual appears
at Athens as opposed to the state, in a manner that would not have
been possible under the earlier <i>régime</i>. Hence in the Middle Comedy,
which is perhaps the earliest individualistic poetry which Athens produced,
ordinary habits and private life come to be treated with an
interest and a realism which had never previously been attempted, and,
as a consequence of this, the Hetaerae come to the fore in literature.
This fact does not, therefore, imply that the position of these women
in the thoughts of men was any higher than had previously been the
case, or that there was a growing idea among the people that love for
women was a worthy subject for artistic study and representation. It
simply means, as will be abundantly clear later on, that the Hetaera
was an important feature in private life, and that, therefore, when
private life came to be represented on the stage, she was bound to
appear there also, just in the same way and for the same reasons as the
cook and the fishmonger, who are also such features of this literature.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_250" href="#FNanchor_250" class="label">[250]</a> With the other distinctive features of Middle Comedy, though
occasional reference may be made to them, we have less to do. It may
not however be amiss, in passing, just to notice the spirit of the age,
which, while it required personal attacks on men to be more or less
veiled, allowed personal attacks of the fiercest description to be made
on women openly by name. A remarkable instance of this is the
<i>Antilais</i> of Epicrates, but it is far from being the only one. As for
those Middle Comedies which are called after public men (<i>e.g.</i> the
<i>Theramenes</i> of Cratinus junior), it would be easy to believe that these
were all, as some of them certainly were, composed after the deaths of
the persons whose names they bear, and that these names were simply
used as types, in the way that Juvenal speaks of Tigellinus, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="label">[251]</a> With regard to what we have described as the second feature of
Middle Comedy, it may perhaps just be remarked that this constant
habit of parodying and ridiculing love-stories would inevitably tend, in
some sort, to bring the whole matter of love into contempt. And that
the feelings of contempt so produced, and the similar feelings which
originated them, would act and react on one another till both became
even more accentuated, was equally inevitable. Nor must it be forgotten
that the influence of tragedy, which might otherwise have served
to counteract this tendency, was much less than it had been at an
earlier period, for the revivals and imitations of Euripides, which held
the tragic stage throughout the century, popular though some of them
may have been, belonged in spirit to the previous generation, and were
thus to a certain extent out of touch with contemporary feeling.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_252" href="#FNanchor_252" class="label">[252]</a> Many plays of this class are called after real or imaginary Hetaerae,

<p><a id="Footnote_255" href="#FNanchor_255" class="label">[255]</a> No one who is familiar with the Middle Comedy is likely to wish

Anaxandrides were similar in character to such plays as the <i>Andria</i> or
the <i>Adelphi</i> of Menander. The exact nature of the παρθένων ἔρωτες
of the Middle Comedy, which form, in fact, an infinitesimal part of

reality no exceptions at all. This will be clear enough if we consider
what is meant in these passages by a κόρη, and do not confuse the
sentiment there expressed with a sentiment which does not occur till
a later period. The κόρη in question (a κιθαρίστρια in the <i>Philaulus</i>)
is merely an Hetaera <i>in posse</i> instead of <i>in esse</i>, an Hetaera who has
not yet entered into regular business, and herein consists her superiority
from the point of view of those who do not share Diogenes’ view as to
the parallel between women and houses. That her attractions do not
differ in kind from those of the regular Hetaera will be plain enough to
anyone who takes the trouble to turn to the passage in the <i>Marathonii</i>,
and that the character of the “love” she inspires is also similar will
be equally apparent from the same lines. That this was the character
of the παρθένων ἔρωτες with which, according to Suidas, Anaxandrides

effort be successfully made, it is no longer hard to understand why,
at the end of the fourth century, the pure girl was a more inspiring

in prehistoric and heroic times, though even here his natural tendency
was to jeer (cp. Aristoph. <i>Equit.</i> 1251); but, imagine such a character

was preposterous.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="label">[287]</a> It is of course obvious that characters such as Clitipho in the

regard matrimony with much enthusiasm, but, in all these cases, the
reasons for their objection are so apparent that no one would consider
them as real exceptions to the general rule that the <i>young man</i> of the
New Comedy looks on marriage with favour.</p>

“quam vellem!” in the latter passage, are spoken by Charinus, not by
Pamphilus: the editors differ on this point.] This curious passage
furnishes a further instance, if further instances be needed, of the fact
that what the Greek required of a woman for a love-match was not so
much physical purity as constancy to a particular lover. Hence we find
that by far the greater mass of Greek romantic love-poetry is addressed,
not to virgins, but to women to whom the writer is, in one way or
another, married. Thus, too, in the romance of Xenophon Ephesius,
the adventures of the lovers all take place after marriage (the wedding
occurs already in chapter viii of book I.), and in this the <i>Ephesiaca</i>
are at least as Greek as, if not more so than the <i>Pastoralia</i> of Longus,
or the novel of Eumathius, where the most ridiculous and desperate
expedients have to be resorted to in order that the heroine may
preserve her virginity till the end of the last chapter. But this whole
matter will be more fully discussed when we come to consider the
Callimachean ideal of woman. [The reference is to a part of the

the only real reason for assigning him to New Comedy at all is,
perhaps, the story of the <i>Rudens</i>, which, Arcturus states in the Prologue,
is derived from this writer. Of the <i>Casina</i> we shall speak

<p><a id="Footnote_335" href="#FNanchor_335" class="label">[335]</a> To take an instance from modern times. M. Daudet is said to
have written his <i>Sappho</i> with the expressed object of showing that
he, too, could produce a work which could not be left lying about.
Similarly, M. Zola may be imagined to have produced <i>La Rêve</i>, in
order to prove that even he could be decent if he tried. But any
attempt to judge of the general character of these authors by the two
books mentioned would be obviously futile. In like manner, in the
case of Philemon, one has to consider how much of the romantic
element in his comedies is due to conviction, and how much to a desire
to show that romantic love-stories were a game two could play at.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_336" href="#FNanchor_336" class="label">[336]</a> Platon. <i>de Com.</i> p. 30. <i>ad fin.</i> The passage distinctly suggests that
these ninety-seven plays were not all that Philemon actually wrote.
σώζεται δὲ αὐτοῦ (Φιλήμονος) δράματα ἑπτὰ πρὸς ἐνενήκοντα. Μένανδρος
... γέγραφε δὲ πάντα δράματα ρη΄.</p>

<p>The view that the total number of his plays was greater than ninety-seven
seems to acquire further probability from the fact that he lived
well-nigh twice as long as Menander, and continued to write up to the
day of his death. Cp. Apul. <i>Flor.</i> 16.—It need hardly be remarked
that if plays of Philemon were already lost in the time of Platonius,
such plays were, in all probability, Middle rather than New Comedies.</p>

was merely the imitator and rival of Menander in this respect; but, of
course, if it be granted that his romantic plays are subsequent to
Menander’s introduction of the subject, it is a matter of indifference
for the present argument whether he afterwards reverted to the older
style or not.</p>

<p>Cp. Athen. vi. 270 C. Similar passages are very common—in
fact, the view may be said to be a universal one; it arises, of course,
from that purely sensual manner of regarding love, on which so much
has already been said. Indeed, those who have read the early Greek
literature with any attention, need perhaps hardly be reminded of how
utterly foreign to the Greek of Euripides’ day is the conception of the
“galante Ritter” setting out in search of ladies that want rescuing.</p>

<p>At the same time, it may not be amiss to emphasise a fact which,
though sufficiently obvious, is yet often ignored. The fact that the
<i>Andromeda</i> was looked upon as a romantic play some centuries later,
even if it can be proved, is no proof that it was intended as such by its
author, or so understood by its original audience. If Hermesianax
could infer from the <i>Odyssey</i> that Homer was in love with Penelope,
one may excuse the contemporaries of Lucian if they inferred from
Euripides that Perseus was in love with Andromeda, but one need not
necessarily regard their inference as a true one.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_356" href="#FNanchor_356" class="label">[356]</a> A very interesting parallel to this scene is furnished by the dream
of Medea (Apoll. Rhod. iii. 625 <i>seqq.</i>); the resemblance is almost too
great to be merely accidental. There too, of course, it need hardly be
remarked, the initiative is on the side of the woman.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_360" href="#FNanchor_360" class="label">[360]</a> Altogether the resemblance between these poems and the Παιδικά
of Theocritus is very marked. Even in the interesting passage (1367
<i>seqq.</i>), where the love of a boy is actually contrasted with that of a
woman, the great charm of the former is said to lie not in κάλλος, but
in χάρις, just as in Theocr. xxx. 4. Whether this resemblance is due to
anything more than the similarity of subject is a difficult question, which
need not be discussed here.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_361" href="#FNanchor_361" class="label">[361]</a> Similarly, I may add, if anyone cares to regard the epigrams

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_364" href="#FNanchor_364" class="label">[364]</a> Is it merely a coincidence that this pioneer of a love-element, of a

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_365" href="#FNanchor_365" class="label">[365]</a> The view that this erotic element was in no respect romantic, but
dealt purely with the sensual side of the matter, is supported by (1) its
inherent probability; (2) the absence of any evidence to the contrary,
not only in the fragments of this writer, but also in those of Antiphanes
and Alexis, who are known to have imitated him; (3) the epithet
παμμίαρος applied to Anaxandrides. (<i>Vide</i> Meineke, <i>Com. Fr.</i> i. p. 369.)
Though the general sense of Suidas’ words seems plain, their exact
meaning is not so clear. Probably ἔρωτας refers to the introduction of
ἑταῖραι and their admirers, whose mutual struggles <i>de nocte locanda</i>
would then provide the action of the play. The sense of παρθένων
φθοράς is even less evident; but the fact that it is mentioned specially,
and after the word ἔρωτας, certainly seems to imply that the φθορά
formed the climax of the action. In other words, the motive of the
plot was the same as in the previous case, with the exception that the
woman in question was a παρθένος instead of an ἑταίρα. If this were so,
then these stories would, of course, differ <i>toto caelo</i> from those of the
New Comedy, where the φθορά is an act of unpremeditated indiscretion
which has taken place before the play begins, and is atoned for by the
hero’s subsequent behaviour.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_366" href="#FNanchor_366" class="label">[366]</a> Cp. Xenarchus, <i>Pentathl.</i> 1, where the same idea is developed.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
